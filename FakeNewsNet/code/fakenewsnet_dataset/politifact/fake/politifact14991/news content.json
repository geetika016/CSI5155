A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/GettyImages-1094206380-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Rob-Reiner-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/coats-of-friendship-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/Adam-Schiff-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/kerryleoclintonchange1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Tom-Emmer-AP-photo-200x150.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/winter-storm-american-flag-jacket-AP-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/Crime-Scene-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/GettyImages-1176830407-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/GettyImages-997710996-200x150.png", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/AP_18318222465634-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/02/Handgun-shop-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Jeff-Sessions-pledge-Getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/GettyImages-900354148-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Getty-Images_Kevin-C.-Cox2-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/wi/ap/01/aa9cdf_trump-impeachment-25-86644-donald-trump-in-25-2019-file-phot-president-donald-200x133.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/Getty-Images_Garrett-W.-Ellwood1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/ICE-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rep.
