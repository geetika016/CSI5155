Though Sofia is half Kourtney\u2019s age, fans can\u2019t help but notice that the 19-year-old has practically become Kourt\u2019s twin.\n\nTake Sofia\u2019s most recent Instagram post as a prime example. Casually posing next to Scott with her sun-kissed glow, Sofia is rocking a thin pair of black sunglasses, high-waisted jean shorts, a billowy white top, and chic white sandals. If that outfit doesn\u2019t scream Kourtney Kardashian, we don\u2019t know what does! Even her pose is Kardashian-esque.\n\nNaturally, fans spoke up about it. \u201cUh, for a moment I thought that was Kourtney Kardashian,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201c[Sofia Richie] looks as if she\u2019s Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s little girl,\u201d wrote another. Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time Sofia has been caught looking like Kourt. In fact, it all started over the holidays in 2017, after Sofia traded in her golden locks for a dark brunette \u2018do. Keep scrolling for some #twinning side-by-side pics of Scott\u2019s present gal looking just like his past.\n\nIt\u2019s not just their taste in fashion that\u2019s eerily similar \u2014 it\u2019s their mannerisms, too. Just take a glance at one of their countless mirror selfies \u2014 both sans pants, of course!\n\nInstagram\n\nThe two women have no problem flaunting their fabulous figures, whether they\u2019re chilling out at home or rocking a barely-there swimsuit at the beach.\n\nEarlier this year, Sofia wore an itty-bitty bikini while in Mexico with Scott, and Lord Disick himself couldn\u2019t help but show her off, posting several shots of her on Instagram. Unlike Kourtney, Sofia isn\u2019t shy when it comes to packing on the PDA with her man, as an onlooker told E! News, \u201cScott and Sofia went in the hot tub and kissed and made out. Scott gave Sofia a massage and they had their arms wrapped around each other. They are very happy together, always cracking each other up and laughing together.\u201d\n\nThough Sofia may be channeling Kourt\u2019s appearance, their personalities are clearly different. While Scott was constantly partying during his on-off romance with Kourtney, an insider told Life & Style that Sofia has actually managed to tame his bad boy ways. \u201cKourtney is giving Sofia credit for turning Scott into a better man, and more importantly, a better father,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cShe\u2019s happy that Scott\u2019s priorities have shifted from nightmare party animal to reliable baby daddy.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kourtney-vs-sofia.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sofia-Richie-Scott-Disick-Miami-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C340px%2C2038px%2C2038px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/candace-cameron-bure-fitness-exclusive-feature.png?crop=351px%2C0px%2C1973px%2C1118px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Top-Chef-judge-Nilou-Motamed-Tips-to-Avoid-Weight-Gain-During-the-Holidays.jpg?crop=0px%2C209px%2C4468px%2C2531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Victoria-Beckham-and-Dr-Lancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1334px%2C756px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sofia-richie-kourtney-kardashian-selfie.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-tristan.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kylie-Jenner-Exclusive-Feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C123px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hannah-Brown-Friends-Urge-Her-to-Date-Alan-Bersten-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C31px%2C1739px%2C985px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kourtney-vs-sofia.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kourtney-sofia-sweats.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jana-Kramer-and-Family.png?crop=0px%2C212px%2C477px%2C270px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kylie-jenner-post-baby-body.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Britney-Spears-singing.jpg?crop=436px%2C0px%2C1601px%2C1601px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kristin-Cavallari.jpg?crop=0px%2C99px%2C4628px%2C2622px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-and-Toneata-Kiss-on-Temptation-Island.png?crop=25px%2C0px%2C2510px%2C1423px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/King-Cairo-and-Dream-Kardashian-Are-Sibling-Goals-Blac-Chyna-Instagram-05.jpg?crop=0px%2C163px%2C703px%2C703px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kourtney-kardashian-vacation-pictures-troll.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kristin-Cavallari-.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C3878px%2C2197px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scott-kourtney-sofia.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chrissy-Teigen-1.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kourtney-sofia-b-suit.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella-Best-Style-Moments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kourtney-vs-sofia.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Kaplan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/sofia-richie-kourtney-kardashian-151741/", "title": "Sofia Richie vs. Kourtney Kardashian?
