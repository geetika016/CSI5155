Mariah Carey\u2019s old mirrors have all been thrown in the trash and replaced with new \u201cskinny\u201d mirrors that make her look 20 pounds lighter, an insider exclusively tells In Touch.\n\n\u201cShe loves them and spends hours looking at her reflection,\u201d the source says of the 48-year-old pop star, who was recently attacked for her weight earlier this summer after flaunting a much filler figure at a concert in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201c[Mariah] has been in a much better mood\u201d since the mirrors were installed, the insider continues, adding that the Grammy winner is \u201cvery much in denial about her weight right now.\u201d But TBH, if skinny mirrors make Mimi feel better, then more power to her!\n\nMariah Carey in a photo from February 2017 (left) and at Caesars Palace on July 18.
