The engaged couple is squabbling about where to live, as In Touch has learned.\n\n\u201cMiley is happy staying put in Malibu, but Liam wants to raise a family in Australia,\u201d a source tells In Touch in the issue currently on newsstands. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting nonstop.\u201d\n\nApparently, the 28-year-old Hunger Games heartthrob covets his family members\u2019 life Down Under. His brother Chris Hemsworth and Chris\u2019s wife, Elsa Pataky, are currently renovating their home in Byron Bay, a beachside town in New South Wales. \u201cHe sees how much happier his brother Chris is since putting down roots there,\u201d the source adds. \u201cLiam\u2019s parents and extended family are all there.\u201d\n\nLiam apparently isn\u2019t as dazzled by Tinseltown as his fianc\u00e9e is. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like being surrounded by industry people like Miley does,\u201d this insider explains.\n\nAs much as Miley may share Liam\u2019s love for Australia, her whole life is in California. And it sounds like the Younger Now singer is worried about transcontinental separation anxiety. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019ll feel isolated and lonely,\u201d In Touch\u2018s source says. \u201cShe\u2019s willing to take extended trips, but she refuses to uproot her entire life.\u201d\n\nEven if the 25-year-old doesn\u2019t want to live abroad, she at least wants to head overseas for her wedding, it seems. The couple is planning to tie the knot in the Himalayas, a different source told Life & Style in March. \u201cMiley has a real hippie side and wants to embrace that rather than spending millions,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe wants to focus on the spiritual side of marriage and is very interested in Hinduism, so she is looking at locations in Nepal, where Hinduism is a way of life.\u201d\n\nSo before Miley and Liam\u2019s nuptials, we\u2019ll give them some pre-marital counseling, free of charge. They should just split their time between the two continents. Problem solved, right?", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sofia-Richie-Scott-Disick-Miami-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C340px%2C2038px%2C2038px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/candace-cameron-bure-fitness-exclusive-feature.png?crop=351px%2C0px%2C1973px%2C1118px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Top-Chef-judge-Nilou-Motamed-Tips-to-Avoid-Weight-Gain-During-the-Holidays.jpg?crop=0px%2C209px%2C4468px%2C2531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Victoria-Beckham-and-Dr-Lancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1334px%2C756px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/where-is-mitchel-musso-in-2017.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kylie-Jenner-Exclusive-Feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C123px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hannah-Brown-Friends-Urge-Her-to-Date-Alan-Bersten-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C31px%2C1739px%2C985px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jana-Kramer-and-Family.png?crop=0px%2C212px%2C477px%2C270px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-6.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Britney-Spears-singing.jpg?crop=436px%2C0px%2C1601px%2C1601px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kristin-Cavallari.jpg?crop=0px%2C99px%2C4628px%2C2622px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bily-ray-cyrus.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-and-Toneata-Kiss-on-Temptation-Island.png?crop=25px%2C0px%2C2510px%2C1423px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/King-Cairo-and-Dream-Kardashian-Are-Sibling-Goals-Blac-Chyna-Instagram-05.jpg?crop=0px%2C163px%2C703px%2C703px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kristin-Cavallari-.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C3878px%2C2197px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chrissy-Teigen-1.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella-Best-Style-Moments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-154360/", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Fighting Over Living in California vs. Australia", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "If you ask Miley Cyrus \u2014 or her 2017 single, at least \u2014 \"the sky's more blue in Malibu.\" Liam Hemsworth, however, thinks the grass is greener 7,000 miles away in Australia.
