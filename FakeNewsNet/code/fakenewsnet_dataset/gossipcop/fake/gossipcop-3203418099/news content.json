Now, it is being revealed he has a big request for the President \u2014 and it involves his youngest daughter Chicago.\n\n\u201cKanye\u2019s infatuated with Trump and is considering asking POTUS to be Chicago\u2019s godfather,\u201d a source told In Touch exclusively. \u201cHe loves, respects, and admires Trump and feels a man of his prestige and power would be a perfect influence in children\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nHowever, his wife Kim Kardashian is completely opposed to the idea. \u201cShe despises Trump and doesn\u2019t like what he stands for and is telling Kanye that he needs to choose somebody else. Kanye\u2019s adamant that he wants to ask Trump and it\u2019s resulted in them having a huge blowout argument,\u201d the source added. \u201cTrump is a huge no no for Kim but Kanye\u2019s really a huge fan and supporter of his and that\u2019s a bone of contention in their marriage.\u201d\n\nIn case you were wondering, North and Saint West\u2018s godmothers are Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney Kardashian, respectively. However, their godfathers have never been revealed.\n\nEarlier this week, it was reported that friends were worried the \u201cFaded\u201d rapper are worried about his current mental health after he spoke with radio host Ebro and allegedly said he loved Trump \u2014 along with claim he had an opioid addiction. On Twitter, Kanye has denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.\u201d He also called himself this generation\u2019s \u201cFord Hughes Jobs Disney.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope Kim wins this godfather battle.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/teen-mom-young-and-pregnant-malorie-baby-daddy.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kanye-west-donald-trump-godfather.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Alia-Shawkat-Brad-Pitt-Friendship-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/stormy-daniels-deposed-trump-denied.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Maitland-Ward-BMW-Reunion.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/stormy-daniels-donald-trump-dress.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/90-Day-Fiance-Nicole-Slams-Strained-Relationship-Rumors-With-Azan-9.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C848px%2C480px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Leah-Messer-Slammed-Daughter-Dressed-Ariana-Grande-Gracie-Looks-15-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1006px%2C1006px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kanye-west-tristan-thompson.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kanye-west-donald-trump-godfather.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_editorial_8611593ak.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C3000px%2C3000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Judge-Awards-Jim-Edmonds-Meghan-King-5050-Custody-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jon-Gosselin-Thanksgiving-Plans-Collin-Hannah-Revealed-Promo.jpg?crop=73px%2C177px%2C995px%2C564px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Justin-Biebers-Friends-Worry-About-Another-Mental-Breakdown.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2372px%2C1344px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kendall-Jenners-Transformation-main.jpg?crop=465px%2C0px%2C3006px%2C3006px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Keanu-Reeves-Move-In-GF-Alexandra-Grant-Soon-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1365px%2C773px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jessica-Biel-Saving-Face-By-Wearing-Her-Ring-After-Justin-Night-Out-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kanye-west-donald-trump-godfather.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kanye-west-donald-trump-godfather-158787/", "title": "Kanye West Wants Donald Trump to Be Chicago\u2019s Godfather (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "We miss the old Kanye...
