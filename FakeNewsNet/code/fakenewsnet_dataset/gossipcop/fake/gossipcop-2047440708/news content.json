{"url": "www.bravotv.com/why-caitlyn-jenner-kept-her-gender-reassignment-surgery-private-from-kris-jenner-kardashian-kids", "text": "\"Of course I didn\u2019t trust them,\" she shares about her decision to keep that side of her life private.\n\nIf you thought 2018 might be the year that Caitlyn Jenner mends fences with Kris Jenner and the Kardashian siblings, then think again. Caitlyn sat down with Piers Morgan this week on Life Stories where she very candidly discussed why she kept her ex-wife and stepchildren out of the loop when it came time for to have her gender reassignment surgery.\n\nThe former Olympian was quite candid about her reasoning, sharing with the talk show host: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell anybody. It\u2019s none of their business. No, it\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d\n\nLater, Piers asked Caitlyn if she didn't trust her family to keep her secret. Her response? \u201cOf course not, of course I didn\u2019t trust them.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn later continued, \u201cI\u2019d already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, nobody knows anything. I didn\u2019t want them to leak it to the press and there was no reason for them to know about it.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn was more open about her life in her 2017 memoir, The Secrets of My Life, which caused a rift between the former Olympian and Kris' ex and kids. In fact, back in November, Caitlyn revealed that things remained strained, so much so that she shared it had been about a year since she spoke to Kim Kardashian. In her interview with Piers Morgan, she shared why she spilled all in her book, but kept her family in the dark: \u201cI had to because I had to be honest. The book is about honesty.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn, however, does appear to remain close to her kids that she had with Kris. She was spotted with Kendall Jenner just this week and has remained quiet about rumors that Kylie Jenner is pregnant.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/363/371/191121_4072298_Kenya_Moore_Regifts_Eva_Marcille___s_Present.jpg?itok=NxsEr3b_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/kandi-burruss-todd-tucker-job.jpg?itok=jhifQcUC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/teresa-giudice-father-hospital-sick.jpg?itok=EBsFDhuK", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/gina-kirschenheiter-tamra-judge-ryan.jpg?itok=sLquCVLH", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-010518-caitlyn-kris-jenner.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-11/lizzie-rovsek-thanksgiving-family-sons.jpg?itok=tLysfC2i", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-rhop-01.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-rhobh-01.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/09/dish-092117-kuwtk-caitlyn-transition.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/656/511/170524_3524346_After_Show__Kim_Kardashian_West___s_Personal.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/21/155/191119_4070822_Teresa_Giudice_Reveals_Joe_Gorga_Was_Engaged.jpg?itok=AhrX2jos", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/tinsley-mortimer-scott-kluth-engaged.jpg?itok=CXp2GZlS", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/05/dish-053117-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?itok=U7MUFNnr", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/08/dish-081617-bruce-kris-kuwtk-idea_1.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/lala-kent-gizelle-bryant-bravocon_1.jpg?itok=KyqXcoy5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/793/627/191120_4071641_Kenya_Moore_Clashes_with_Cynthia_Bailey.jpg?itok=3I0rVRYM", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-10/eva-marcille_1.jpg?itok=0nYM6__u", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-bd-med.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-sc-01.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-11/reza-farahan-mj-javid-friendship.jpg?itok=DjG-w6v5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-10/rhoc-aftershow-playlist-promote.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-010518-caitlyn-kris-jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jocelyn Vena"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/why-caitlyn-jenner-kept-her-gender-reassignment-surgery-private-from-kris-jenner-kardashian-kids", "title": "This Is Why Caitlyn Jenner Kept Her Gender Reassignment Surgery Private from Kris Jenner", "meta_data": {"title": "Caitlyn Jenner Discusses Gender Reassignment Surgery, Kris Jenner Rift | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "If you thought 2018 might be the year that Caitlyn Jenner mends fences with Kris Jenner and the Kardashian siblings, then think again.
