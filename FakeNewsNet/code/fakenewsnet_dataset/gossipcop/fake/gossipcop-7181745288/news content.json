The 40-year-old rapper went on a bizarre rant about philosophy, \u201cthe psychological zombie effect,\u201d and his love for Donald Trump. He even shared photos of himself wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. But things took a turn for the worse when Kanye suggested that 400 years of slavery was a choice during a TMZ interview, and now Kim Kardashian is at \u201cher breaking point.\u201d According to Life & Style, the mother-of-three wants a divorce after Kanye\u2019s latest outburts. However, it looks like there\u2019s still one person who\u2019s welcoming him with open arms \u2014 and that\u2019s Caitlyn Jenner.\n\n\u201cKanye\u2019s been staying at Cait\u2019s the past few nights,\u201d an insider exclusively tells In Touch. \u201cShe\u2019s literally the only woman in the Kardashian clan who\u2019s showing him major love as he expresses his political views. She understands him. She gets him. She loves him. And she\u2019s incredibly supportive of his conservative views and only wants to encourage him to be his best self \u2014 just like he supported her when she was transitioning.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret Caitlyn has been a longtime supporter of Trump, even when people slammed her for betraying the LGBTQ communtiy. But more than that, Caitlyn \u2014 who has a distant relationship with the Kardashians after bashing Kris Jenner in her memoir \u2014 understands what it\u2019s like to be at the center of controversy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s feeling a tremendous amount of resentment and backlash from his wife and her family, his friends in the hip-hop community, and many of his fans,\u201d the source explains. \u201cBut through it all, he\u2019s found peace, serenity, acceptance, and comfort in Cait\u2019s house and he\u2019ll never forget how much she\u2019s been there for him.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by In Touch, Kim is mostly concerned about her husband ruining her family\u2019s brand. \u201cKim is losing it,\u201d the source revealed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want Kanye putting himself out there like he\u2019s doing because it\u2019s ruining his brand and her family\u2019s image. She thinks he\u2019s doing more damage to their empire than good.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/teen-mom-young-and-pregnant-malorie-baby-daddy.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kanye-west-emma-gonzalez-twitter.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kanye-west-staying-with-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?resize=750%2C495", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kanye-west-staying-with-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Alia-Shawkat-Brad-Pitt-Friendship-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Maitland-Ward-BMW-Reunion.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kanye-charlamagne-tha-god-interview.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/90-Day-Fiance-Nicole-Slams-Strained-Relationship-Rumors-With-Azan-9.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C848px%2C480px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Leah-Messer-Slammed-Daughter-Dressed-Ariana-Grande-Gracie-Looks-15-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1006px%2C1006px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_editorial_8611593ak.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C3000px%2C3000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kanye-west-moms-death.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Judge-Awards-Jim-Edmonds-Meghan-King-5050-Custody-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jon-Gosselin-Thanksgiving-Plans-Collin-Hannah-Revealed-Promo.jpg?crop=73px%2C177px%2C995px%2C564px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Justin-Biebers-Friends-Worry-About-Another-Mental-Breakdown.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2372px%2C1344px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kendall-Jenners-Transformation-main.jpg?crop=465px%2C0px%2C3006px%2C3006px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Keanu-Reeves-Move-In-GF-Alexandra-Grant-Soon-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1365px%2C773px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jessica-Biel-Saving-Face-By-Wearing-Her-Ring-After-Justin-Night-Out-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kanye-west-staying-with-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?resize=750%2C495", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Corvino"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kanye-west-staying-with-caitlyn-jenner-twitter-rant-159298/", "title": "Kanye West Is Staying With Caitlyn Jenner Following Slavery Comments and Twitter Rant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "After Kanye West spiraled out of control on Twitter last week, his family is keeping their distance.
