It\u2019s also how quickly Justin sprang into action after their seven-year relationship ended.\n\n\u201cJen believes they both should have laid low for the first few months and given their relationship a bit of a mourning period,\u201d the source says. \u201cInstead, Justin\u2019s been acting like a man who was just let out of prison. Jen feels betrayed.\u201d\n\nFor more celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!", "images":
