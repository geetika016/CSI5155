The country music superstar just clapped back at his ex-wife with a little help from fellow country music singer, Luke Bryan. Buddies Blake and Luke performed a seemingly innocent rendition of George Strait\u2019s \u201cAll My Exes Live In Texas\u201d \u2014 but considering the fact that Miranda was recently called out for shading her husband, this choice of song hardly seems coincidental.\n\nLuke\u2019s wife, Caroline, posted a photo of her hubby dressed up like Blake for the performance. \u201cBlake Bryan. Luke really wanted to capture the vintage Blake look\u2026.but he actually looks like Luke from our college days. #1998 #bluke #crashmyplaya,\u201d she wrote. The singers the performed the song which fans are calling now Blake\u2019s way of subtly shading his ex who is a proud Texas native.\n\nRecently, during Miranda\u2019s Livin\u2019 Like Hippies tour, she performed her fan-favorite hit, \u201cLittle Red Wagon,\u201d which references the years she spent married to Blake. During a Greenville, SC, concert last week, she made an unexpected update to the single\u2019s lyrics. The original lyrics are: \u201cOh, you only love me for my big sunglasses / And my Tony Lomas / I live in Oklahoma,\u201d but in the concert version, Miranda changed the \u201cI live in Oklahoma\u201d line to \u201cI got the hell out of Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nMiranda is originally from Texas but moved to Blake\u2019s home state of Oklahoma when they got married in 2011. After they split in 2015, she moved to Nashville \u2014 but clearly hasn\u2019t left her failed marriage in the past. Especially since Blake has remained in Oklahoma where he is frequently spotted around town with his new girlfriend, Gwen Stefani.\n\nMiranda also moved on with boyfriend, Anderson East but is still clearly scarred from her divorce from Blake. \u201cThe cold-blooded way Blake blindsided her with divorce, drove her out of his life, and then shoved his romance with Gwen [Stefani] in her face is something that will scar her forever,\u201d an insider exclusively told Life & Style. \u201cIt still burns her.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sofia-Richie-Scott-Disick-Miami-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C340px%2C2038px%2C2038px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-kids.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/miranda-lambert.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/candace-cameron-bure-fitness-exclusive-feature.png?crop=351px%2C0px%2C1973px%2C1118px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Top-Chef-judge-Nilou-Motamed-Tips-to-Avoid-Weight-Gain-During-the-Holidays.jpg?crop=0px%2C209px%2C4468px%2C2531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Victoria-Beckham-and-Dr-Lancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1334px%2C756px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kylie-Jenner-Exclusive-Feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C123px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blake-shelton-luke-bryan.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hannah-Brown-Friends-Urge-Her-to-Date-Alan-Bersten-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C31px%2C1739px%2C985px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jana-Kramer-and-Family.png?crop=0px%2C212px%2C477px%2C270px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Britney-Spears-singing.jpg?crop=436px%2C0px%2C1601px%2C1601px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kristin-Cavallari.jpg?crop=0px%2C99px%2C4628px%2C2622px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/David-and-Toneata-Kiss-on-Temptation-Island.png?crop=25px%2C0px%2C2510px%2C1423px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/King-Cairo-and-Dream-Kardashian-Are-Sibling-Goals-Blac-Chyna-Instagram-05.jpg?crop=0px%2C163px%2C703px%2C703px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/blake-shelton-2.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kristin-Cavallari-.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C3878px%2C2197px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blake-shelton-luke-bryan.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chrissy-Teigen-1.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella-Best-Style-Moments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blake-shelton-luke-bryan.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paulina Jayne Isaac"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert-luke-bryan-clap-back-152450/", "title": "Blake Shelton Claps Back at Miranda Lambert With Help From Luke Bryan", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Divorce is never easy... especially when you're Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert.
