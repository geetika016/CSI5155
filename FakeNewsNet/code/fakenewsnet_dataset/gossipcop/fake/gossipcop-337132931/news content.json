Caitlyn and Sophia frequently appear in each other's social media feeds, and Sophia accompanied Caitlyn to the ESPY Awards in July, though they weren't red carpet official.\n\nNaturally, people have been assuming that they are a couple, but Caitlyn and Sophia both denied that they're in a relationship when asked by Variety, which concluded they \"sound like a couple.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not going to get into that,\u201d Caitlyn told the publication. \u201cBut we are very close. We do a lot of things together. We\u2019re kind of inseparable. We\u2019re the best of friends.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn has been open about being isolated from her children \u2014 one of whom, Kendall Jenner, is the same age as Sophia.\n\n\"I spend a lot of time by myself here in the house,\" she revealed to Broadly. \"I have a lot of children, but sometimes just because of circumstances, maintaining a close relationship with your kids is very tough. They all have lives. They've all moved on.\"", "images":
