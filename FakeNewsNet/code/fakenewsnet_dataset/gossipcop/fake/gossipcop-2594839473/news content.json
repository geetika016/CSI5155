A waterfront plot in Museum Park was turned down by the city commissioners. A Little Havana plot near Marlins Park \u2013 the home of the city\u2019s baseball team \u2013 was felled by Miami's hatred for the Marlins Park venue.\n\nIn January he announced he had finally found his site, in the Overtown district. But the area, described by the Miami Herald in December 2016 as \u201cground zero\u201d for the city\u2019s opioid crisis, was soon deemed unsuitable.\n\nOn Thursday, with his deep-pocketed business partner Jorge Mas beside him, he unveiled his fifth plan \u2013 a $1 billion (\u00a3760m) project to be called Miami Freedom Park, involving the leasing and redevelopment of the city-owned Melreese golf course near Miami International Airport. The plan would include the construction of a 25,000-seat stadium, plus restaurant and retail space, office buildings, hotels, athletic fields and a public park.\n\nIn addition to the privately-funded construction, Beckham's group would also pay $4-5 million in annual rent for the 73 acres of land, as well as state, county, city and school board taxes, reaching an estimated total of $44 million.\n\nHis presence in the city on Thursday was celebrated by football fans, with hundreds trying to pour into the city commission meeting. But it was lamented by golf aficionados, deeply concerned at the loss of the city\u2019s only public course.\n\nEven sports stars turned against Beckham.\n\nRay Allen, a former star of the basketball team Miami Heat, urged people to sign a petition against Beckham\u2019s plan, arguing that it will mean the end of the city\u2019s First Tee youth golf programme.\n\n\u201cMelreese has an awesome First Tee program that is ran out of this course that really teaches young children the game of golf and gives them a public place to play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot to mention all the great tournaments and events the course hosts. If you\u2019re familiar with Miami at all, there aren\u2019t too many public courses for our kids to play at.\u201d\n\nOrlando \u201cEl Duque\u201d Hernandez, a former Major League Baseball pitcher, donned the orange First Tee polo shirts worn by protesters, and said he volunteers for the programme.\n\nThe agonising wait for Beckham was prolonged by Ken Russell, chairman of the commission, a man who was perceived as the swing vote among the deeply divided group. He criticised the Beckham group for not conducting any outreach in the neighbourhood immediately east of Melreese. He then sought verbal assurances from them on issues from the replacement of lost park space, to the question of who would pay for cleaning up contaminated soil.\n\nHe also wanted assurances that workers on the project would be paid a living wage.\n\n\u201cWe can continue to negotiate,\u201d said Mr Russell. \u201cBut I\u2019m not ready tonight.\u201d\n\nA new hearing was set for 10am on Wednesday.\n\nFrancis Suarez, the mayor of Miami who has spoken passionately in favour of the referendum, expressed his frustration with the commission\u2019s decision to defer the vote.\n\n\u201cI really wish they would\u2019ve made a decision tonight,\u201d he said, in comments surely echoing Beckham\u2019s own thoughts. \u201cSo then we could have moved to the next phase.\u201d", "images":
