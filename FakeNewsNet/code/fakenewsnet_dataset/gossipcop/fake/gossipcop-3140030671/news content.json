The former One Direction singer and the \u201cX Factor UK\u201d judge announced their split on Sunday after nearly two years together. The two have a 1-year-old son together, Bear.\n\nVenturelli via Getty Images Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole attend the Chopard Tropy Ceremony on May 12, 2016 in Cannes.\n\n\u201cWe are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It\u2019s been a tough decision for us to make,\u201d the joint statement said, which appeared somewhat differently on the pair\u2019s respective Twitter accounts. \u201cWe still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.\u201d\n\nWe are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It's been a tough decision for us to make. We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together. \u2014 Cheryl (@CherylOfficial) July 1, 2018\n\nThe two first met on a 2008 episode of \u201cX Factor,\u201d when Payne was a 14-year-old contestant and Cole was a judge. After his audition, Cole said, \u201cI like you, I think you\u2019re really cute. I think you\u2019ve got charisma \u2015 you know \u2015 when you give us that cheeky little wink.\u201d\n\nThough Payne didn\u2019t advance in the show at the time, he later locked eyes with Cole when he reappeared on the show in 2010 and was paired with his future One Direction stars. \u201cX Factor UK\u201d gave Payne the career of a lifetime, but the 24-year-old told the radio station \u201cThe Hits\u201d that his favorite moment on the show involved Cheryl, saying \u201cI think when I winked at my Mrs. on the show, before she was my Mrs. I think it\u2019s just the best thing ever.\u201d The two began dating in 2015 shortly after Cole split from her second husband, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini (she was previously married to soccer player Ashley Cole). They made things official \u2014 with an Instagram photo, of course \u2014 in early 2016.\n\nA post shared by Liam Payne (@liampayne) on Mar 2, 2016 at 8:34am PST\n\nThe two announced that Cole had given birth to their first child, a son named Bear, in March 2017. People first confirmed the pregnancy in November 2016. \u201cOn Wednesday 22nd March Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy, weighing 7lb 9 and looking like a dream,\u201d Cole wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cAlthough he still doesn\u2019t have a name he is already stealing hearts. We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival. Happy Mother\u2019s Day to all the mothers around the world. A day that now has a different meaning to me forever.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Cheryl (@cherylofficial) on Mar 25, 2017 at 1:25pm PDT", "images":
