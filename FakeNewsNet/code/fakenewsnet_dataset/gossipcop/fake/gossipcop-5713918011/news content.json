People are having a bad time \u2014 that's horrible.\"\n\nTheroux continued, saying he believes it's \"nonsense\" that Aniston is being talked about in relation to Pitt and Jolie's divorce.\n\n\"There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,\" Theroux said.\n\n\"But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to b*tch about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.\"\n\nAlmost as soon as news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from her husband of two years (and partner of 12), Jennifer Aniston was brought into the conversation, even though she and Pitt divorced in 2005 after five years of marriage.\n\nMemes and gifs of Aniston's \"reaction\" to the divorce sprouted up, and tabloids began to speculate on what she said when she heard the news.", "images":
