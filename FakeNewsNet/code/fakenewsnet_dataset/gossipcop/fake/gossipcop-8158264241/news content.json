But the 20-year-old beauty mogul had the most to say about little Stormi. She told Kardashian all about what surprised her most about motherhood and even admitted that she likes changing her daughter\u2019s diapers.\n\n\u201cI think more about the future because of her. Every time I leave and I\u2019m stressed about leaving her, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m doing it for you,\u2019\u201d Jenner said. \u201cEveryone says you change completely when you become a mom, but I really feel the same, just better. So I don\u2019t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s only gotten better. You\u2019re less selfish \u2014 and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It\u2019s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don\u2019t know, the whole thing is really\u2026 it\u2019s like such an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nScott and Jenner, who are currently on vacation together, celebrated their daughter\u2019s three-month birthday on Tuesday, sharing an adorable photo on Instagram.", "images": ["https://amp.assets.huffpost.com/assets-b634cd05f81d666a8b746d5a77c0876e/images/icons/newsletter-toaster.png",
