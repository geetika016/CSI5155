Though he was later overshadowed by Kevin Federline and his fedora, Jason Allen Alexander had a good 55 hours of fame thanks to his two-day marriage to Britney Spears. Who can forget how the tabloids were splashed with the happy (and totes not intoxicated couple): Britney Spears in her wedding ripped-jeans-and-baseball-cap, Jason hulking over her with that unfortunate Caesar haircut and power-brows. Stunning.\n\nSo how did this happen? After a night of clubbing with her childhood friend, the pair put on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and got inspired. Dude, not even kidding.\n\n\"It was just so crazy, man,\" Alexander told Access Hollywood in the aftermath. \"We were just looking at each other and said, 'Let's do something wild, crazy. Let's go get married, just for the hell of it.'\"\n\nSo they hit up Vegas' Little White Wedding Chapel to get hitched in what we can only imagine was a very romantic ceremony. The bellman walked the bride down the aisle. Someone please hand us a tissue.\n\nObviously, Britney and her people realized that life isn't an episode of Friends and there are serious consequences to f\u2013king up this bad. Jive records positioned it as a joke that had gone \"too far.\" Jason scoffed at this, \"I was in love with her,\" he said in 2012. \"I feel like she felt the same way.\" K.\n\nIn any case, the marriage was annulled and that's the last we heard of this guy until he made headlines in 2016 for spending jail time for domestic abuse against a woman he was dating. So in the long run, we guess Britney was better off moving on to KFed.\n\nWell. Maybe.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-allen-alexander.jpg?fit=200%2C140", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Celebs-With-the-Most-Outrageous-Demands-in-Hollywood-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/teen-mom-young-and-pregnant-malorie-baby-daddy.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tara-Reid-Transformation-Promo.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Alia-Shawkat-Brad-Pitt-Friendship-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Maitland-Ward-BMW-Reunion.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/90-Day-Fiance-Nicole-Slams-Strained-Relationship-Rumors-With-Azan-9.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C848px%2C480px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Leah-Messer-Slammed-Daughter-Dressed-Ariana-Grande-Gracie-Looks-15-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1006px%2C1006px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_editorial_8611593ak.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C3000px%2C3000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-allen-alexander.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Judge-Awards-Jim-Edmonds-Meghan-King-5050-Custody-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jon-Gosselin-Thanksgiving-Plans-Collin-Hannah-Revealed-Promo.jpg?crop=73px%2C177px%2C995px%2C564px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Justin-Biebers-Friends-Worry-About-Another-Mental-Breakdown.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2372px%2C1344px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kendall-Jenners-Transformation-main.jpg?crop=465px%2C0px%2C3006px%2C3006px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Keanu-Reeves-Move-In-GF-Alexandra-Grant-Soon-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1365px%2C773px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jessica-Biel-Saving-Face-By-Wearing-Her-Ring-After-Justin-Night-Out-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ojani-noa.jpg?fit=200%2C159"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-allen-alexander.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Grace Garis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/britney-spears-married-las-vegas-150874/", "title": "Britney Spears Married in Las Vegas in 2004: Who TF Was That Guy?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Only in crumbling old tabloids do we tend to remember the starter husbands married to a celebrity in the earliest aughts of her career.
