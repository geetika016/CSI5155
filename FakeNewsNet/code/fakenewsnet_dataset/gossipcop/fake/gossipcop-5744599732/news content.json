They were very close and he will miss her dearly. He is staying strong and leaning on close friends and other family during this challenging time.\u201d\n\nMORE: Suri Cruise Is All Grown Up \u2014 See the Pic\n\nAccording to reports, Mary died peacefully in her sleep and was sent off with a Scientology ceremony. She was also the one who encouraged Tom to pursue an acting career.\n\nTom and Katie tied the knot in November 2006 and ended their marriage in August 2012. They are also parents to a 10-year-old daughter, Suri \u2014 though Tom hasn\u2019t seen her in quite some time.\n\n\u201cThey used to Skype and text, but that trailed off drastically. He uses his film commitments as an excuse, but the truth is that doesn\u2019t hold much weight with Suri anymore,\u201d a source previously told In Touch. \u201cTom eats, breathes and sleeps Scientology. He\u2019s disconnected from Katie, and then de facto from Suri, because of her connection to Katie. He hasn\u2019t seen her since she was seven.\u201d\n\nKatie moved on from the relationship with actor Jamie Foxx, and they were recently spotted spending New Year\u2019s Eve together in Miami.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very serious,\u201d said a source.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom was recently rumored to be dating a British woman.\n\nMORE: Enter Here for Your Chance to Win a Trip to Miami\n\nWe think it\u2019s great that these two can still lean on each other in the most difficult times \u2014 and hope this could lead to him reconnecting with his daughter.\n\nOur thoughts are with Mary\u2019s loved ones in the wake of this tragedy.", "images":
