The Associated Press file\n\nA fake image of a Twitter post purporting to show \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Joy Behar expressing her wish that President Donald Trump had died in a blaze Saturday at Trump Tower has gone viral.\n\nA blaze broke out Saturday on the 50th floor of the president\u2019s New York tower, killing resident Todd Brassner, 67, and injuring six firefighters, reported CNN.\n\nImages of the purported Twitter post from Behar, dated Saturday, read, \u201cFire at Trump tower, one dead \u2013 Hopefully it\u2019s Trump.\u201d The image went viral Monday on Facebook and Twitter, with some posters claiming that Behar had since removed or deleted the post.\n\nThis is truly sick. Liberals don't even hide the fact anymore that they wish for the death of our President. Last week...
