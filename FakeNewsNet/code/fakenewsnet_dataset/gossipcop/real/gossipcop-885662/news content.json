On Sunday, the board of directors of the Weinstein Company terminated him citing \u201cnew information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Streep\u2019s full statement:\n\n\u201cThe disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\u201d\n\nWeinstein was initially suspended by his eponymous company following the revelations, which included claims from former staffers as well as actresses like Ashley Judd. And on Friday, TV reporter Lauren Sivan told HuffPost exclusively that Weinstein had cornered her at a restaurant closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.\n\nMembers of the entertainment community have come under fire for being slow in responding to the Weinstein crisis. Over the weekend, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Executive Producer Lorne Michaels came under fire for cutting jokes from the show that involved Weinstein. The New York Times reported that several jokes were tested during dress rehearsal but that they \u201cfell flat\u201d with the studio audience.\n\nMichaels said he cut the jokes because Weinstein is a \u201cNew York thing,\u201d meaning that he didn\u2019t feel a national audience would appreciate the jokes.\n\nMost of the late-night hosts, including Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, omitted the story in their Thursday night broadcasts. On \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d host Trevor Noah on Thursday made only a passing reference to Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was a prominent donor to Democratic candidates and liberal causes and was a frequent guest at the White Houses of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Some Democrats who received donations from him have pledged to donate the money to other causes.\n\nWhile some Hollywood stars have called out Weinstein, including younger actors like Lena Dunham and Amber Tamblyn, longtime collaborators like Gwyneth Paltrow and Quentin Tarantino have remained silent.\n\nFollow Yashar \u2014 or send him a tip \u2014 on Twitter: @yashar", "images":
