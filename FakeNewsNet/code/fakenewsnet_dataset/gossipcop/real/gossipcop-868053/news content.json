[Shaking my damn head].\u201d\n\nHart and wife \u2014 Eniko Parrish, 32 \u2014 married last August in a lavish California ceremony after a two-year engagement and many years together. \u201cI already feel married, the wedding is really just for her,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly at the time.\n\nThe couple broke their baby news in May, telling PEOPLE that they are expecting their first child together \u2014 a little boy. \u201cWe are overjoyed about our new addition to our family,\u201d they said in a joint statement.
