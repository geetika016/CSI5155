Lil Peep earned his highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 2018 with \"Falling Down\", featuring XXXTentacion, which peaked at number 13.[15] Lil Peep's second studio album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2 (2018) debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, making it his first US top 10 album.[16] The compilation album Everybody's Everything was released on the 2nd anniversary of his death.[17]\n\nLil Peep was a frequent user of drugs due to his mental health, including depression and bipolar disorder.[18] He died on November 15, 2017, exactly two weeks after his 21st birthday. The Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner certified the cause of death to be an accidental overdose of fentanyl and Xanax.[19][20]\n\nEarly life\n\nGustav Elijah \u00c5hr was born on November 1, 1996, in Allentown, Pennsylvania to first-grade teacher Liza Womack and college professor Karl Johan \u00c5hr.[21] He had one sibling, Karl \"Oskar\" \u00c5hr.[22] \u00c5hr grew up on Long Island, New York.[23] His parents were both Harvard graduates who divorced when he was a teenager.[23][24] \u00c5hr was of Irish descent on his mother's side and Swedish and German descent on his father's side.[25] \u00c5hr claimed to have Swedish citizenship on Twitter.[26]\n\nGrowing up, \u00c5hr's father was absent.[27] with his father and mother divorcing formally when \u00c5hr was 14.[28] He attended Lindell Elementary School and then Long Beach High School in Lido Beach, New York, which he rarely attended in spite of good grades[29] and was on the deans list for the time he attended.[30] He later dropped out of the high school and took online courses to earn his diploma.[31] Shortly thereafter, he began posting his music on YouTube and SoundCloud.\n\nWhen \u00c5hr was 17, he got his first face tattoo, a broken-heart below his left eye to help motivate him to make music[32] before he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music, under the pseudonym Lil Peep.[33] \u00c5hr stated that his reason for moving out to Los Angeles was due to feeling depressed living on Long Island.[27]\n\nCareer\n\nWhen Lil Peep was a teenager, he called himself a loner who made a majority of his friends online. Inspired by underground acts like Seshhollowaterboyz and iLoveMakonnen.[34] Peep was making music while residing in Long Island[35] under the pseudonym \"Trap Goose\"[28] and lived temporarily with childhood friend Brennan Savage until both decided to move to Los Angeles.[36]\n\nLil Peep left high school early to move to Los Angeles and meet up with online friends. Initially living in Skid Row, Los Angeles and dipping in and out of homelessness,[30] staying in Brennan Savage's apartment while Savage pursued a degree. The two eventually went separate ways[36] and Peep met Atlanta rapper and producer JGRXXN and Florida rappers Ghostemane and Craig Xen, living with them while forming the collective Schemaposse.[37] According to Lil Peep, he originally met Craig Xen online and was introduced to JGRXXN who needed a singer.[38] Lil Peep also attempted to attend Glendale Community College during his first year living in Los Angeles.[21] In 2015, Lil Peep released his first mixtape, Lil Peep; Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever.[39][40]\n\nLil Peep (left) performing with Fat Nick in 2016\n\nLil Peep began to grow in popularity soon after, with the song \"Star Shopping\" (later released as a single following his death[41]) from Lil Peep; Part One making waves in underground hip-hop circles.[37] Lil Peep's popularity continued to grow after the release of the song \"Beamer Boy\" which led to him performing live for the first time with the rest of Schemaposse in March 2016 in Tucson, Arizona.[42] The following month, Schemaposse broke up and Lil Peep was not associated with any collective though they remained on good terms.[43] Shortly after the breakup of Schemaposse, Peep remained living in Skid Row, Los Angeles though he had begun to associate with Los Angeles-based rap collective, Gothboiclique, featuring members of the group on his full-length mixtape Crybaby.[44] The group shared a squat in Skid Row with Peep and often shared beds.[32] According to Lil Peep, Crybaby was recorded within the space of three days with a $150 microphone. He did a majority of the mixing and mastering himself.[34] Crybaby was released in June 2016.[34] Later than month, First Access Entertainment (FAE) partnered with Lil Peep on a joint venture to invest in and advise him on his career.[45]\n\nIn addition to providing business guidance, co-founder/CEO, Sarah Stennett, was also a friend who gave both moral and financial support - helping Peep realize his vision. In September 2016, Lil Peep released Hellboy.[46] Songs from Hellboy such as \"Girls\" and \"OMFG\" began to clock in millions of views and plays on SoundCloud and YouTube.[47] The success from Hellboy led to Peep going on his first-ever solo tour across the United States, called \"The Peep Show\" tour, starting in April 2017 and ending in May 2017.[48] In May 2017, the band Mineral accused Peep of copyright infringement for including an unlicensed and uncredited sample of their song \"LoveLetterTypewriter\" in his \"Hollywood Dreaming\" track. Peep said that he was only trying to \"show some love\" with the sample.[49]\n\nSoon after the tour was done, Peep immigrated to London, England during a disentanglement with his collective Gothboiclique. In London, Peep began to associate with a new set of people encompassing of figures such as Atlanta rapper iLoveMakonnen and long-term friend Bexey (fka Bexey Swan.) While living in London, Peep recorded Come Over When You're Sober Pt, 1 and Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2, an EP entitled Goth Angel Sinner and an untitled project with iLoveMakonnen.[50][51][52] Peep released his debut studio album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 on August 15, 2017.[53] Lil Peep also announced and took part in his first World tour, starting in the UK in September[54] and moving to Germany before finishing in the United States in November which was cut short due to his untimely death.[55]\n\nPosthumous releases\n\nGoth Angel Sinner EP[56] Lil Peep in Holland performing his unreleased song \"Moving On\" from his upcomingEP\n\nAfter his death, Lil Peep's fanbase and popularity grew quickly which resulted in a significant increase in sales and streams of his music.[57] The single \"Awful Things\" from Come Over When You're Sober, Part One charted, becoming his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 79.\n\nDue to Peep's prolific work rate, a number of songs and projects were completed prior to his death.

In a time where genuine individuality is becoming increasingly obsolete, Peep was the tattoo-covered, Manic Panic-hued mall rat the creative world needed to disrupt its ever-growing homogeny.\"[80] Rapper Playboi Carti described Lil Peep as a \"trendsetter\".[80]\n\nIn late 2018, it was announced that a Lil Peep clothing line was being created called \"No Smoking\" (stylized as \"NO SMOK!NG\") which was developed before Lil Peep's death.[81]\n\nMusical style\n\nLil Peep was described as making lo-fi rap,[82] being an \"emo-trap heart throb\"[83] and an \"emo rapper\".[84][85] New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica defined Peep as the Kurt Cobain of lo-fi rap and described his music as gloomy and diabolically melodic.[86] Lil Peep's music generally drew on both Southern rap and the angsty introspection of the rock subgenre post-hardcore.[87] He said that he wanted to become the \"New Kurt Cobain\".[23] Lil Peep's lyrical themes include topics such as depression, drug use, past relationships, and suicidal thoughts and meshes together third-wave emo, alternative rock, pop-punk and dream pop with trap music and hip-hop.[88] A close friend and the executive producer of Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 said that Peep \"wanted give a voice to people that suffer from anxiety and depression, people who have been abused, bullied, and the people who were misunderstood like him. He had demons of his own and he faced those demons by creating music.\"[35] AllMusic described his music as a blend of hip hop and rock influences along with trap, punk, and dream pop.[88] He had also been described as the future of emo by Steven J. Horowitz of online magazine Pitchfork.[89]\n\nBefore the release of his first album, he mentioned Kurt Cobain, David Bowie, Frank Ocean and Riff Raff as inspirations, and wanted to be known as the \"Kurt Cobain of Rap\".[23] Lil Peep also cited Anthony Kiedis as his idol.[90][91] His other musical influences include Gucci Mane, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Future, Crystal Castles, Seshollowaterboyz, Rozz Dyliams, My Chemical Romance and Panic! at the Disco.[92] His songs have sampled such artists as Blink-182, Pierce the Veil, Brand New, Radiohead, Underoath, Three Days Grace, Avenged Sevenfold, Slayer, The Postal Service, Oasis and The Microphones.[93][94]\n\nDeath\n\nOn November 15, 2017, Lil Peep was found dead on his tour bus when his manager went to check on him in preparation for that night's performance at a Tucson, Arizona venue.[95] Foul play was not suspected,[96] with his death believed to be from an overdose.[97] In a series of Instagram posts in the hours leading up to his death, Lil Peep claimed to have ingested psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis concentrate.

Lil Peep's manager performed CPR before medics arrived, though he was pronounced dead at the scene.[99] Lil Peep's death was recorded on Instagram by his friend Bexey Swan, who believed Lil Peep was asleep.[100] On December 8, the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner released details from a toxicology report, certifying the cause of death was an accidental overdose due to the effects of the pain medication fentanyl and the benzodiazepine alprazolam.[19] Blood tests were positive for cannabis, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol. Urine tests also showed the presence of multiple powerful opiates, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone (dilaudid), oxycodone and oxymorphone.

He incorporated a \"resurgence of rap rock\" with his adaption of using hard guitar rifts into his music and being a part of the emergence of emo rap. He is commonly cited as an inspiration for upcoming \"emo rappers\" even as his music was considered by many as 'underground'.[117]\n\nPersonal life\n\nLil Peep came out as bisexual on a Twitter post in August 2017;[118][119][120] around this time he was dating the actress and singer Bella Thorne.[121] While on the Come Over When You're Sober tour, he had met and started dating Instagram influencer, Arzaylea Rodriguez around the time of his death in November.[122]\n\nLil Peep had a close relationship with his mother, going so far as to tattoo her initials and birthday on his arm as his first tattoo at the age of fourteen.[12] He played the trombone and tuba[123] and expressed an interest in music and fashion from a young age. At the time of his death, Lil Peep was residing in Portobello Road, London with his friend and close collaborator, Bexey[124][27] and Smokeasac. The move was provoked by Peep's need to escape his circumstances and his then-collective GOTHBOICLIQUE.[51]\n\nLil Peep actively talked about his issues with depression, anxiety and substance abuse and stated that he had bipolar disorder,[27] saying in an interview with Pitchfork \"I suffer from depression and some days I wake up and I'm like, 'Fuck, I wish I didn't wake up'\"[125] and saying to Vice \"I have horrible anxiety, that's why I took Xanax before this interview.\"[27] In his final interview before his death with Zane Lowe, Peep confessed that his depression was getting worse saying \"Things just get worse. Things already get worse and worse and worse every day.\"[126] Lil Peep regularly referenced addictions to cocaine, ecstasy and Xanax in his lyrics and posts on social media,[127][128] where he described himself as a \"productive junkie\" and advised his audience to avoid drug use.[129]\n\nLil Peep may have been a fan of the National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils, as he can be seen wearing a shirt bearing their logo on the cover of his mixtape, Hellboy.[5]\n\nDiscography\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Lil_Peep%2C_Holland%2C_October_2017.png/260px-Lil_Peep%2C_Holland%2C_October_2017.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Audio_a.svg/24px-Audio_a.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Lil-Peep_PrettyPuke_Photoshoot.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg/24px-Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Lil-Peep_PrettyPuke_Photoshoot.png/240px-Lil-Peep_PrettyPuke_Photoshoot.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/24px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lil_Peep_%26_Fat_Nick%2C_Texas%2C_November_2016.jpg/340px-Lil_Peep_%26_Fat_Nick%2C_Texas%2C_November_2016.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Nuvola_LGBT_flag.svg/21px-Nuvola_LGBT_flag.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/21px-P_vip.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Lil-Peep_PrettyPuke_Photoshoot.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Peep", "title": "Wikipedia", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.5", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Lil-Peep_PrettyPuke_Photoshoot.png"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
