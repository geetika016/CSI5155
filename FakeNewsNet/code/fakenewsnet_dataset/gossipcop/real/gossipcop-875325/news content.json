It seems the artist is moving into a new era \u2014 and will be taking that snake motif along with her.\n\nIn a way, Swift has always been associated with snakes: she was born in 1989, the year of the snake by the Chinese zodiac, and even titled her last album 1989. But previously, the slithery symbol was not an association she claimed or wanted as part of her narrative.\n\nBack in June 2016, Swift and DJ Calvin Harris ended their relationship in what seemed an amicable fashion. Soon after, Swift made it public that she had co-written the chart-topping hit \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d for Harris under a pseudonym. In response, Harris fans soon took to Twitter to start hitting Swift with snake emojis. Snakes are, in biblical mythology and contemporary shorthand, cunning creatures. Some of Swift\u2019s critics who felt the public reveal undermined Harris\u2019s own success used snakes to share their belief that she had serpentine qualities of her own.\n\nThen in February 2016, Kanye West dropped his now-infamous rap song \u201cFamous\u201d off his album The Life of Pablo. One line, in particular, stood out: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b\u2014h famous,\u201d he sings. Up to that point, West and Swift had a fraught-turned-friendly history. While West had (notoriously) intercepted her win at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009, they had afterwards mended fences, even sharing dinner and expressing plans to collaborate.\n\nBut after \u201cFamous\u201d came out, Swift condemned the line as misogynistic and expressed that she was not privy to the use of her name in that context. For West\u2019s part, he said he had an \u201chour long convo with [Taylor] about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.\u201d\n\nIn June 2016, Kim Kardashian West further supported her husband\u2019s claim, telling GQ she had footage of a phone conversation in which Swift gave her approval to the lyric. And in July, Kim shared snippets of the taped audio of the phone call in question on her Snapchat story. Swift herself took to Instagram to respond, saying \u201cyou cannot \u2018approve\u2019 a song you haven\u2019t heard,\u201d and requested. to be \u201cexcluded from this narrative.\u201d\n\nThe internet erupted into a frenzy. Coined the #KimExposedTaylorParty, Swift once again was bombarded with snake emojis. Feeding the fray, Kim even tweeted (obliquely) about \u201cNational Snake Day\u201d in a seeming reference to Swift.\n\nThe snake emojis disappeared soon enough from Swift\u2019s profiles. (Her Instagram account was the platform\u2019s first test case of a filter to remove select words or emojis on certain feeds.)\n\nGet The Brief.

It\u2019s unclear what role snakes will play in her next steps.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-sexiest-man-alive.jpg?quality=85&w=594", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/michelle-obama-ellen-degeneres-twitter-duet.jpg?quality=85&w=600"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4914211/taylor-swift-snakes-timeline/", "title": "Read the Full History of Taylor Swift and Snakes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "taylor swift, taylor swift snakes, taylor swift instagram, taylor swift snake emoji, taylor kim kanye, taylor swift controversy, snake emojis", "news_keywords": "taylor swift, taylor swift snakes, taylor swift instagram, taylor swift snake emoji, taylor kim kanye, taylor swift controversy, snake emojis", "description": "The '1989' singer has a fraught history with snakes \u2014\u00a0and snake emojis \u2014\u00a0thanks to a feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian last year.", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Has a History With Snakes: Here's the Backstory", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4914211/taylor-swift-snakes-timeline/", "description": "Everything you need to know about Taylor Swift and snakes", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4914211/taylor-swift-snakes-timeline/", "description": "The '1989' singer has a fraught history with snakes \u2014\u00a0and snake emojis \u2014\u00a0thanks to a feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian last year.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4914211/taylor-swift-snakes-timeline/", "title": "Taylor Swift Has a History With Snakes: Here's the Backstory", "description": "Everything you need to know about Taylor Swift and snakes", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taylor-swift.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
