Is there anything more exciting \u2015 or potentially torturous?\n\nThat\u2019s the question a new animated short film asks while beautifully depicting the angst and trepidation that can blossom right alongside a budding infatuation \u2015 especially for LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cIn A Heartbeat,\u201d by Beth David and Esteban Bravo, tells the story of Sherwin, an awkward, young teen, whose heart literally pops out of his chest and chases after his classmate Jonathan. Sherwin is then forced to chase down his heart before it reveals how he feels to his crush.\n\nDavid and Bravo, who made the film at Ringling College of Art, completed the project thanks to a Kickstarter campaign that generated over $14,000. Watch thee full film above.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started working on this film, we knew that we didn\u2019t want it to be preachy,\u201d the filmmakers previously told HuffPost. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even dialogue, so we never have the characters speak to persuade the audience of anything. We simply wanted to show the audience what growing up was like for us through this story about a sweet, red-headed boy who feels just as confused and scared about his feelings as we did. Hopefully, it\u2019ll resonate with those who identify with this character - and for those who don\u2019t, we hope they\u2019ll gain an understanding for people who go through this experience.\u201d\n\nMission Accomplished: We laughed, we cried, we laughed some more.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de54ec3210000a0a334ebdb.jpeg?cache=y0WHrFP2cY&ops=150_150",
