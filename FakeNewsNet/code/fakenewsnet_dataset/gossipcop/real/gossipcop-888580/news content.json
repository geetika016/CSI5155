The TV host shared a new photo of his \u201chappy and healthy\u201d little boy via Instagram on Saturday, Oct. 21.\n\n\u201cYoung Billy is six months old today. He is healthy and happy and we are all very grateful for your prayers, good wishes, thoughts, and support of @ChildrensLA and children\u2019s hospitals in your area,\u201d he wrote on the social media platform. This update comes just one month after Billy made his first public appearance following his open-heart surgery.\n\nThree months ago, Jimmy gave a similar update on Billy \u2014 and we\u2019re so glad that he\u2019s continuing to do better! \u201cBilly is three months old and doing great,\u201d the 49-year-old star wrote on Instagram alongside an adorable new photo of his little boy smiling at the camera at the time. \u201cThanks for the love and support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got.\u201d\n\nThe late night host tearfully revealed Billy\u2019s birth and subsequent health problems during an emotional, 13-minute Jimmy Kimmel Live! monologue back in May. \u201cA little over a week ago, on Friday, April 21st, my wife, [Molly], gave birth to a baby boy. His name is William John Kimmel,\u201d he began while holding back tears. \u201cWe call him Billy. He was an easy delivery \u2014 only six pushes out. He appeared to be a normal, healthy baby until about three hours after he was born.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Monday morning, Dr. Vaughn Starnes opened his chest and fixed one of the two defects in his heart. He went in there with a scalpel and did some kind of magic that I couldn\u2019t even begin to explain,\u201d Jimmy continued. \u201cHe opened the valve, and the operation was a success. It was the longest three hours of my life.\u201d Thankfully, sweet little Billy is now healthy, and Jimmy even admitted at the time, \u201cHe peed on his mother today while she was changing his diaper. He\u2019s doing all the things that he\u2019s supposed to do.\u201d\n\nJimmy and his wife, Molly McNeary, 39, previously announced they were expecting their second baby together in December 2016. The couple \u2014 who tied the knot in July 2013 \u2014 are already parents to a three-year-old daughter, Jane Kimmel. The TV star is additionally a father to two older kids \u2014 daughter Katie Kimmel, 26, and son Kevin Kimmel, 24 \u2014 from his first marriage to Gina Kimmel. Here\u2019s hoping we get to see more pictures of little Billy in the near future!\n\nPart of this story originally appeared on NowToLove.com.\n\nMore From Closer Weekly\n\n\n\nAshton Kutcher Jokes Daughter Wyatt Wants to \u201cKill\u201d Baby Brother Dimitri\n\nJimmy Kimmel Will Return in 2018 to Host the Oscars\n\nHoda Kotb on New Life With Baby Haley \u2014 \u201cMotherhood Is the Best Job I\u2019ve Ever Had\u201d", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_editorial_390976d.jpg?crop=147px%2C213px%2C1820px%2C1820px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/prince-george-and-princess-charlotte-christmas-gifts.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C2968px%2C1682px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Says-Her-Familys-Christmas-Day-Tradition-Is-to-Serve-at-a-Homeless-Shelter-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mountain-mamas-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C13px%2C768px%2C435px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hgtv-stars-mountain-mamas.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C954px%2C541px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/william-frawley-i-love-lucy-cast-in-color.jpg?crop=399px%2C0px%2C824px%2C824px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Prince-william-is-close-to-kates-parents.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3163px%2C1792px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oliver-Kate-Hudson-recall-parents-having-child-1.jpg?crop=70px%2C0px%2C1852px%2C1852px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wayne-brady-daughter.jpg?crop=485px%2C53px%2C2637px%2C1494px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-baby-billy.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/angela-lansbury-jessica-fletcher.jpg?crop=0px%2C336px%2C1144px%2C648px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Shares-the-Secret-to-Her-Marriage-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/father-knows-best-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-baby-billy.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/tyrabanks_13181298_1068779926512470_1505875086_n.jpg?crop=143px%2C0px%2C684px%2C683px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gwen-stefani-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C2400px%2C2400px&resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-baby-billy.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Closer Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jimmy-kimmel-baby-heart-disease-131386/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Shares New Photo of Baby Son Billy After Heart Disease Diagnosis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Just a few months after Jimmy Kimmel's baby son was born with heart disease, the proud dad has given fans an update on Billy's health today!
