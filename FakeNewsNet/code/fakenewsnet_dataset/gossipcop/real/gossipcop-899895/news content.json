Everyone\u2019s going to come to my house for dinner.\u2019 George begins to say, \u2018Listen, I want you guys to know how much you\u2019ve meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,\u2019\u201d recalled the restauranteur.\n\n\u201cI came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I\u2019m so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn\u2019t be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we\u2019re still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases,\u2019\u201d Clooney said, according to Gerber. \u201cWe open it up, and it\u2019s $1 million dollars in $20 bills. Every one of us \u2013 14 of us \u2013 got $1 million. Every single one of us. We\u2019re in shock.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amal-clooney-5.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amal-clooney-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C642.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amal-clooney-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C642.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/george-clooney-amal-clooney-pass-out-headphones-to-passengers-on-flight-with-6-month-old-twins/", "title": "George & Amal Clooney Pass Out Headphones to Fellow Passengers on Flight with 6-Month-Old Twins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "george clooney, amal clooney, clooney twins, Ella clooney, Alexander Clooney, casamigos, rande gerber", "news_keywords": "george clooney, amal clooney, clooney twins, Ella clooney, Alexander Clooney, casamigos, rande gerber", "description": "George and Amal Clooney passed out noise-canceling headphones during a recent flight to Amal's native England, a source confirms to PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "George &amp; Amal Clooney Pass Out Headphones to Fellow Passengers on Flight with 6-Month-Old Twins", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/george-clooney-amal-clooney-pass-out-headphones-to-passengers-on-flight-with-6-month-old-twins/", "description": "George and Amal Clooney passed out noise-canceling headphones during a recent flight to Amal's native England, a source confirms to PEOPLE", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amal-clooney-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C642.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/george-clooney-amal-clooney-pass-out-headphones-to-passengers-on-flight-with-6-month-old-twins/", "description": "George and Amal Clooney passed out noise-canceling headphones during a recent flight to Amal's native England, a source confirms to PEOPLE", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amal-clooney-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C642.075px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/george-clooney-amal-clooney-pass-out-headphones-to-passengers-on-flight-with-6-month-old-twins/", "title": "George &amp; Amal Clooney Pass Out Headphones to Fellow Passengers on Flight with 6-Month-Old Twins", "description": "George and Amal Clooney passed out noise-canceling headphones during a recent flight to Amal's native England, a source confirms to PEOPLE", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amal-clooney-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C642.075px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
