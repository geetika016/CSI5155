But basically it meant that she couldn\u2019t eat normal food.\u201d\n\nDr. Dubrow said his was a female patient who\u2019d stabbed her own breast implants on the advice of a surgeon.\n\n\u201cThis season on 'Botched,' I had a patient who had a really bad breast problem and didn\u2019t have enough money to have it fixed, so the plastic surgeon said, \u2018Well if you go home and stab your implants and rupture them, the implant company will pay.'\" \u201cSo she went home on his advice and stabbed her breasts, and it turned into a giant disaster. \u201c\n\nThe doctors said they also had to treat a man who had most of his nose bitten off by a dog, while the most bizarre case of the series goes to the first ever woman to get her pubic hair transplanted onto her eyebrows. Outside of their show, the surgeons admitted they don\u2019t always agree to treat potential patients, and regularly turn people away if they\u2019re not good candidates.\n\n\u201cMany times. In fact, 30 percent of my patients who sat down yesterday,\u201d Dr. Nassif said. \u201cThe reason why is because they want something unrealistic.\u201d\n\nWatch Dr. Dubrow talk about the most botched surgery he\u2019s ever come across.", "images": ["https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/18/screen-shot-2019-11-18-at-10-21-360x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/10/29/stylebd-ep6038-360x240.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/09/18/ootd-main-ep6005-360x240-1.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/21/slick-woods-300x150.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/25/justin-timberlake-alisha-wainwright-300x150.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/08/02/insta03-360x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/21/tr-6058-0891-480x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2018/12/06/article-botched-surgeries-1200x630.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/19/olay-teaser-480x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/09/11/fall-trends-main-360x240.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/27/godfrey-gao-300x150.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/08/30/kim-kardashian-west-300x150.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/08/02/insta04-360x360.jpg", "http://warnerbros.112.2o7.net/b/ss/wbrosthereal/1/JS-1.5.1--NS/s1575286374?AQB=1&ce=UTF-8&ns=warnerbros&pageName=articles%3Acollection%3A%3Abotched-doctors-terry-dubrow-and-paul-nassif-reveal-the-most-shocking-surgeries&c1=TheReal.us&v1=TheReal.us&c2=collection&v2=collection&c3=articles&v3=articles&events=event6&AQE=1", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/18/screen-shot-2019-11-18-at-10-22-360x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2018/09/07/bounce-logo-black-1.png", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/21/tr-6061-1423-480x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/08/screen-shot-2019-11-08-at-12-16-360x360.jpg", "https://assets.thereal.com/thereal.com/main/default/img/the-real-logo-enhanced.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000013&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.thereal.com/2018/12/06/article-botched-surgeries-750x460.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/09/27/prints-gallery-main-360x240-1.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/22/french-montana-300x150.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/26/glowbiotics-logo-480x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/08/screen-shot-2019-11-08-at-12-14-360x360.jpg", "https://media.thereal.com/2019/11/22/grace-eleyae-main-480x360.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.thereal.com/2018/12/06/article-botched-surgeries-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thereal.com/2018/12/05/botched-doctors-terry-dubrow-and-paul-nassif-reveal-the-most-shocking-surgeries/", "title": "'Botched' Doctors Terry Dubrow & Paul Nassif Reveal the Most Shocking Surgeries", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"account_id": 1482663290, "therealdaytime": 1482663290, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@therealdaytime", "title": "'Botched' Doctors Terry Dubrow & Paul Nassif Reveal the Most Shocking Surgeries", "description": "\"Botched\" docs Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif left the ladies in shock when they shared some of the most botched surgeries they\u2019ve worked on.", "image": "https://media.thereal.com/2018/12/06/article-botched-surgeries-1200x630.jpg"}, "google-site-verification": "WldWGjdAIkdvvKCxVgTlrLUulVrI3OcPbuzpxPcdIgQ", "p": {"domain_verify": "a5782eebd2efed706d88bf3566b6619c"}, "keywords": "Beauty, PaulNassif, TerryDubrow", "description": "\"Botched\" docs Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif left the ladies in shock when they shared some of the most botched surgeries they\u2019ve worked on.", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"url": "https://thereal.com/2018/12/05/botched-doctors-terry-dubrow-and-paul-nassif-reveal-the-most-shocking-surgeries/", "site_name": "TheReal", "type": "article", "title": "'Botched' Doctors Terry Dubrow & Paul Nassif Reveal the Most Shocking Surgeries", "description": "\"Botched\" docs Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif left the ladies in shock when they shared some of the most botched surgeries they\u2019ve worked on.", "image": "https://media.thereal.com/2018/12/06/article-botched-surgeries-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 147468615443945, "pages": 268107083329227}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/therealdaytime"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/EE_g564Snjs?autoplay=1&rel=0"], "publish_date": 1543986000.0, "source": "http://thereal.com", "summary": ""}
