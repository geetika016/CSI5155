Lets go get em,\u201d the mother of three wrote, paraphrasing her husband\u2019s words that kick off the track.\n\nThe star also posted GIFs from the single\u2019s music video as part of three consecutive posts in regular Beyonc\u00e9 fashion.\n\nIn the music video, Beyonc\u00e9 appeared as JAY-Z\u2019s girlfriend and it fueled speculation about their then-secret relationship. Nearly six years later, in April 2008, the pair married in a secret wedding ceremony.\n\nNot only did Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s relationship with JAY-Z start after their collaboration, the single was also her first solo feature recording after breaking off from Destiny\u2019s Child.\n\nFollowing \u201c\u201903 Bonnie & Clyde,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first solo album, Dangerously in Love, was released in June 2003, after former band members, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, debuted their own solo projects.\n\nSince then, Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z have also collaborated for songs and music videos, including \u201cPart II (On the Run).\u201d Inspired by Bonnie and Clyde, the video was dreamt up as a faux trailer to promote the pair\u2019s joint tour. The footage also featured cameos from Jake Gyllenhaal, Blake Lively and Rashida Jones.\n\nFast forward to the present, Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z are parents to three children: 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy and 3-month-old twins Rumi and Sir. And the superstar duo has been spending most of their time in Los Angeles, after moving to the West Coast from New York City in 2015.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-bonnie-clyde-15-year-anniversary/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 'Can't Believe' It's Been 15 Years Since She and Husband JAY-Z Released 'Bonnie & Clyde'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "jay-z, beyonce, bonnie and clyde, beyonce husband, jay-z wife,", "news_keywords": "jay-z, beyonce, bonnie and clyde, beyonce husband, jay-z wife,", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on husband Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002", "og": {"title": "Beyonc\u00e9 'Can't Believe' It's Been 15 Years Since She and Husband JAY-Z Released 'Bonnie &amp; Clyde'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-bonnie-clyde-15-year-anniversary/", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on husband Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-bonnie-clyde-15-year-anniversary/", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on husband Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-bonnie-clyde-15-year-anniversary/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 'Can't Believe' It's Been 15 Years Since She and Husband JAY-Z Released 'Bonnie &amp; Clyde'", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on husband Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
