(Khloe Kardashian via Snapchat)\n\n\"I've never had a surprise party in my life! I was blown away!\" Kardashian tweeted on June 26, referring to her 33rd birthday party from the night before. \"Im so lucky and blessed! Thank you so much baby!!! You treat me like a queen!\"\n\nKhloe Kardashian reportedly expecting child with Tristan Thompson\n\nKardashian is reportedly four months pregnant.\n\nThat said, there's plenty of evidence that the Polaroid photo wasn't meant to be taken literally. People close to Kardashian and Thompson told TMZ at the time that \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" were simply syrupy nicknames they used for each other.\n\nKardashian also suggested she was hungover in a tweet on the same day she posted the \"Dad + Mom\" picture.\n\nThe reality star revealed over the summer that she had gotten off of birth control during a testimonial segment on \"Keeping up with the Kardashians.\"\n\n\u2018This Is Us\u2019 predicted the Kardashian and Jenner pregnancies\n\nKhloe Kardashian's dramatic transformation\n\n\"He wants to have about five or six kids with me and that's lovely,\" Kardashian said on the show. \"We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I'm not on birth control is scary. It's like a really big step.\"\n\nHer pregnancy news came less than a week after reports emerged that her 20-year-old half-sister Kylie Jenner is pregnant as well. Her older sister Kim, meanwhile, is reportedly expecting a child via surrogate.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-af_gBGFZgopbs.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525445.1506538243!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/khloe28f-4-web.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://static1.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2597859.1460482166!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635_424/102717833-gthmb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525447.1506540489!/img/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/article_750/khloe28f-1-web.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525447.1506540489!/img/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/khloe28f-1-web.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/nydn/img/static/rh-subscribe.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/nydn/img/static/envelope.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/nydn/img/static/rh-app.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/nydn/img/static/notification.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3524111.1506496137!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_198/september-27-2017-american-tragedy.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525447.1506540489!/img/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/khloe28f-1-web.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/khloe-kardashian-dropped-clue-pregnant-june-article-1.3525448", "title": "Khloe Kardashian may have dropped a clue she was pregnant in June", "meta_data": {"nydn_section": "Gossip", "fb": {"app_id": 107464888913, "admins": 1594068001, "pages": "268914272540,176080452497593"}, "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "title": "Khloe Kardashian may have dropped a clue she was pregnant in June", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/khloe-kardashian-dropped-clue-pregnant-june-article-1.3525448", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525447.1506540489!/img/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/khloe28f-1-web.JPG", "description": "The reality star may have hinted she was pregnant months ago."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nydailynews", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/khloe-kardashian-dropped-clue-pregnant-june-article-1.3525448", "title": "Khloe Kardashian may have dropped a clue she was pregnant in June", "description": "The reality star may have hinted she was pregnant months ago.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170927210915im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525447.1506540489!/img/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/khloe28f-1-web.JPG"}, "description": "The reality star may have hinted she was pregnant months ago.", "nydn_tags": "khloe kardashian, tristan thompson", "nydn_byline": "PETER SBLENDORIO", "parsely-title": "Khloe Kardashian may have dropped a clue she was pregnant in June", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/khloe-kardashian-dropped-clue-pregnant-june-article-1.3525448", "parsely-type": "article", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3525447.1506540489!/img/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/khloe28f-1-web.JPG", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-27T18:51:26", "parsely-section": "Gossip", "parsely-author": "Peter Sblendorio", "parsely-tags": "khloe kardashian, tristan thompson", "robots": "NOARCHIVE"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
