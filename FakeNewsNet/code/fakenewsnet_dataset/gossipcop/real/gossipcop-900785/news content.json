Barnum ringmaster costume -- towards the back lot containing a large historical set, the performance kicked off with Jackman singing a quieter verse, before going big and tossing his cane to another performer.\n\nAs soon as Jackman finished his verse, the camera swung to Efron, with an unexpected mustache, and Zendaya, wearing her character's pink wig, dancing and singing on the steps of a building.\n\nKeala Settle, who plays the Bearded Lady in the film, joined the rest of the cast next as the camera revealed just how many dancers filled the streets of the set.\n\nJackman then nailed a tricky top hat flip, as more and more dancers in colorful turn of the century costumes joined for the big finale, featuring more circus performers alongside the main cast.\n\nFor the big finish, Settle hit a high note and snow fell from the sky over the rightfully triumphant Jackman and his co-stars.\n\nThe whole performance took about three minutes, but as revealed on social media, required a lot of rehearsal.\n\nPrior to the number, Efron tweeted a sped-up behind-the-scenes video, showing the cast in street clothes during a run through.\n\nJackman also shared some rehearsal videos on Instagram, writing, \"No turning back now ... T minus 4 hours-ish. FOX. LIVE. COMMERCIAL. TONIGHT.\"\n\nHe also revealed he was nervous about pulling off his top hat trick. \"Please let me hit the hat trick!!!\" he wrote in the caption on another vid.\n\nThe Greatest Showman is in theaters Dec. 20.
