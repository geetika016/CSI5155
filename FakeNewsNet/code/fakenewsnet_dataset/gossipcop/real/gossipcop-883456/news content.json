Vikander and Fassbender exchanged vows at the luxurious La Granja farmstead resort surrounded by friends and family, sources previously told PEOPLE.\n\nImage zoom Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\nThe star of the upcoming Tomb Raider reboot went on to admit that the pair \u2014 who met in late 2014 while filming The Light Between Oceans \u2014 might even consider working together again under the right circumstances.\n\n\u201cWe had a great experience, apart from the fact that we\u2026,\u201d Vikander told Vogue before glancing down at her wedding ring with a laugh.\n\nAfter calling her husband \u201cone of the absolute best actors I\u2019ve worked with,\u201d the Academy Award-winning actress explained how even though he had more experience than she did when they began filming the movie, he never looked down on her and even asked her for advice on his character.\n\n\u201cOf course he\u2019d done more films than me, but immediately when we started to work together he was so open to wanting me to chip in new ideas and thoughts,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe would be like, \u2018I\u2019m stuck; what should I do?\u2019 and I would say, \u2018You\u2019re asking me?\u2019 That was such a sweet thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife is about a lot more than work, but if it\u2019s also your biggest passion, of course it\u2019s something you enjoy talking about,\u201d she added.\n\nImage zoom

they stopped to take a few photos with fans.\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander: Inside the Newly Married Couple\u2019s Romanc\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Alicia Vikander is White Hot

Light Between Oceans, they spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the importance of keeping their relationship private. \u201cI think we\u2019ve made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us,\u201d Vikander said. \u201cIt was very easy to unite, but that\u2019s quite personal.\u201d", "images":
