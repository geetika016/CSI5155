(#NeverForget Todd Kraines.)\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, after quite a bit of wine, Kris Jenner gets inspired to make some prank calls of her own with her daughter Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\n\n\u201cHey Siri! Siri!\u201d begins Jenner, 61, tapping excitedly at her phone. \u201cSiri, could you please call the hotel?\u201d\n\nPutting on a fake accent, Jenner asks to be connected to \u201cKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that I have her registered as a guest here at the hotel,\u201d says the operator politely.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s wild,\u201d Jenner drawls. \u201cI think she\u2019s under another name, I think it\u2019s something like Funny Bunny. Or Fred Flintstone. That\u2019s the two that I know she normally goes under.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Here\u2019s How Much It Will Cost You to Vacation Like a Kardashian\n\nHer next victim is a kind man working at a bakery, who patiently sits through a conversation about rhubarb pie and \u201ctoelogists,\u201d because Jenner\u2019s foot is \u201ckilling her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d says Kardashian to her mom later. \u201cYour prank calls, honestly, are the best. You have me crying.\u201d\n\nSame, Khlo\u00e9. Same.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kris-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kris-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-tipsy-prank-calls-keeping-up-kardashians/", "title": "Kris Jenner Prank Calls Random People with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2014 a Few Glasses of Wine Deep", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kris jenner, kris jenner prank call, kardashian prank call, kuwtk, keeping up with the kardashians", "news_keywords": "kris jenner, kris jenner prank call, kardashian prank call, kuwtk, keeping up with the kardashians", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "og": {"title": "Kris Jenner Prank Calls Random People with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2014 a Few Glasses of Wine Deep", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-tipsy-prank-calls-keeping-up-kardashians/", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kris-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-tipsy-prank-calls-keeping-up-kardashians/", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kris-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-tipsy-prank-calls-keeping-up-kardashians/", "title": "Kris Jenner Prank Calls Random People with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2014 a Few Glasses of Wine Deep", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kris-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/97n3EcK9RjQ"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
