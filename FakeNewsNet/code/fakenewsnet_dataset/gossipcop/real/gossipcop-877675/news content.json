But now, years later, they can both laugh about that turbulent time in their relationship.\n\nThe supermodel tweeted on Monday tweeted an article about the short-lived breakup, writing, \u201c11 years later, baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a a typical breakup,\u201d the mom of one wrote in a follow-up tweet. \u201cHe was on tour and his voice hurt and he was being a whiny face about everything and so yeah, I was like \u2018no.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIt was Legend\u2019s recent interview with The Guardian that prompted Teigen\u2019s trip down memory lane.\n\nIt wasn't a a typical breakup. He was on tour and his voice hurt and he was being a whiny face about everything and so yeah, I was like \"no\" \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 5, 2017\n\n\ud83d\ude02 11 years later, baby https://t.co/Kr7p7u8sqq \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 5, 2017\n\n\u201cI was really stressed and busy,\u201d he told the publication of the rough patch. \u201cI was just like, \u2018I\u2019d just be happier single right now,\u2019 and she was like, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe split lasted for less than a day (as Teigen previously recalled), and the couple were quickly back together.\n\n\u201cShe pushes me to be funnier,\u201d he says. \u201cNot because she\u2019s trying to. I think it\u2019s just being around her. And to be bolder.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Learn How To Make XOXO Pancakes for Your Valentine\n\nIn the years since the snafu, the stars have become a constant source of #RelationshipGoals with Legend being the most loving celebrity husband around.\n\nTeigen and the R&B singer wed in 2013 in Italy after becoming engaged in 2011.\n\nTeigen talked previously about the brief breakup in last year\u2019s December issue of Cosmopolitan, revealing that she and her husband laugh about the ordeal now.\n\n\u201cI always joke, \u2018Remember when you tried to break up with me?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Yes, sorry.
