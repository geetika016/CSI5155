If you make a purchase using the links included, we may earn commission.\n\n'Tis the magical season for showing appreciation to your loved ones. And as editors here, we're privileged to be surrounded by beautiful, inspiring and exciting new designs every day, so it feels like we've been researching for this all year.\n\nFor our gift guides this year, we've been busy scouring the depth of the internet for the best gift ideas that will delight everyone on your list\u2014even the pickiest. From the foodie fiend, to the new parents, to the photographer, to the dog-obsessed, or the one on your list who needs a little TLC. But sometimes its the most personal of recommendations that spark the best ideas.\n\nRelated: The Best Luxury Backpacks to Take with You on Your Next Trip\n\nWhich is why we're letting you in on our gift-giving arsenal of ideas to both give (family, friends, and loved ones should look away now) and also the gifts we'd love to receive (you can look back now and take notes, friends). From a lightweight and luxurious travel bag that our style director can't travel without, to elaborate porcelain decor, rare wines, and a new classic watch, there's something for every type of luxury shopper you love.\n\nHere's what our editors are either hoping to score this season or to gift to the favorite people in their life.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Montunas\n\n\n\nMontunas Convertible Canvas Backpack with Cognac\n\n\"I recently traveled around the world with a shockingly spacious Montunas bucket bag that converts to a backpack \u2014 the chicest answer to the latter half of the \u201ccarry on plus personal item\u201d rule, and something nearly all of my friends have already covetously asked (/ hinted) about.\"\n\nAlessandra Codinha, Style Director\n\nTo buy: $628; montunas.com\n\n\n\nCourtesy Moda Operandi\n\n\n\nAugarten Wien Espresso Cup And Saucer\n\n\"Maybe it\u2019s because I share my home with two rambunctious young kids who break everything in their sight, but I dream of one day surrounding myself with elaborate porcelain tableware, like this hand-painted espresso cup and saucer by Augarten Wien.\"\n\nFlora Stubbs, Features Director\n\nTo buy: $420; modaoperandi.com\n\n\n\nCourtesy Tor Wines\n\n\n\nTOR's Black Magic Cabernet Sauvignon\n\n\u201cMention Tor Kenward to someone who really knows about wine and watch them light up, the way someone does when they find out you haven\u2019t read their favorite novel, heard their favorite album, or experienced the place that turned them into a travel junkie. Kenward, who has been in Napa for fifty years, gets fruit from the best lots at the best vineyards, something you can only do when you have the kind of clout he has. Then he does as little as possible. \"Our job as winemakers,\u201d he says, \u201cis to stay out of the way\u201d and let the grapes speak for themselves. This December what I\u2019m looking forward to most is Tor\u2019s Black Magic, the rarest of the rare wines Kenward makes only in great years. Worthy spends to celebrate the end of the year.\u201d\n\nBen Ryder Howe, Senior Editor\n\nTo buy: $350 for 750 ML or $800 for a magnum; torwines.com\n\n\n\nCourtesy Leatherology\n\n\n\nDeluxe Passport Cover + Luggage Tag Set\n\n\"My favorite thing to get my travel-loving friends is a cute and custom passport and luggage tag set. I love the ones from Leatherology, they feel special with the personalization and they make traveling and navigating the airport more fun and stylish.\"\n\nAlessandra Amodio, Photo Editor\n\nTo buy: $85, leatherology.com\n\n\n\nCourtesy Saks Fifth Avenue\n\n\n\nShowstopping Backgammon Sets\n\n\"There's nothing I look forward to more during the holidays than settling somewhere cozy with wine, friends, and some backgammon. Though I love finding old sets when traveling (Marrakech's old medina has some gems) I'm eyeing up a few online. For traditional, there's a timeless investment piece like Aerin's croc leather set (to buy: $3,150; saksfifthavenue.com) that can be passed down for generations; for on-the-go play there's Hector Saxe's suede Victor Travel set (to buy: $475; barneys.com) that rolls up and fastens; or check out this cheery and chic acrylic set from Australian outdoor accessories label SunnyLife (to buy: $160; shopbop.com).\"\n\nTal Dekel-Daks, Audience Engagement Editor\n\n\n\nCourtesy Rouje\n\n\n\nRouje ARTHUR Cardigan\n\n\"I\u2019ve been going through a serious cardigan phase for a little over a year\u2014in large part because I travel so much, and also because sweaters need to occupy prime real estate in my closet on account of living in Vermont. I find cardigans to be timeless pieces that layer well (an oversized one is a great way to stay cozy on long flights), and they\u2019re just really versatile. This one, from Paris-based brand Rouje (which is helmed by fashion icon and French It-girl Jeanne Damas), is feminine and flirty and also looks impossibly soft.\"\n\nEllie Nan Storck, Associate Digital Editor\n\nTo buy: $165; rouje.com\n\n\n\nFrom Left: Courtesy Wine.com [2]; Courtesy Caskers; Courtesy Astor Wines\n\n\n\nAlcohol Gifts For the Booze Hound\n\n\"Whether it\u2019s for the holidays, birthdays, or as a thank you, I\u2019m a huge proponent of giving gifts that are consumable. Some can find it difficult to justify spending a hefty chunk of change on a nice bottle of whiskey or a fine bottle of wine, which is why the holidays are a great excuse to pamper the ones that you love. For the red wine lover, a bottle of Mount Peak Cabernet Sauvignon Sentinel (To buy: $60; wine.com), which has a Sonoma sweetness but the structure of a Napa wine. White wine drinkers will love a bottle of Cloudy Bay Te Koko Sauvignon Blanc (To buy: $76; wine.com) for its vibrant acidity and notes of beeswax, chamomile, and honeysuckle.\n\nFor the whiskey aficionado, a bottle of Michter\u2019s 10 Year Single Barrel Rye (To buy: $240; caskers.com) is perfect\u2014it has a strong vanilla aroma and finishes with notes of clove and butter. For the gin drinker, go for a bottle of Monkey47 (To buy: $76; astorwines.com). One of the best gins on the market right now, Monkey47 offers a complex array of botanicals while also being juniper-forward. Whatever bottle you go with, I\u2019m sure whoever is the gift recipient will be more than thrilled.\"\n\nSean Flynn, Deputy Digital Editor\n\n19th Century Sapphire and Diamond Cluster Earrings\n\n\u201cI melt over anything from FD Gallery, located on the Upper East Side, Manhattan. Their rare and vintage fine jewelry finds, in particular, (from a 1940s diamond \u2018Trombino\u2019 ring by Bulgari to a diamond elephant pendant by Boivin) are utterly breathtaking and make for truly special gifts. For the holidays, I\u2019m lusting over these plush 19th-century sapphire and diamond cluster earrings.\u201d\n\nAnnie Davidson, Editor\n\nTo buy: Price available on request; (212) 772-2440\n\n\n\nCourtesy Net-a-Porter\n\n\n\nGalop d'Herm\u00e8s' Watch\n\n\"I didn\u2019t think any watch could top my love for the classic Herm\u00e8s Cape Cod, but the new Galop shape is an instant classic. This holiday season, I\u2019m taking a less is more approach, investing in pieces that have quality and lasting appeal. I can see myself passing this watch on to my daughters.\"\n\nMelissa Ventosa Martin, Fashion Director\n\nTo buy: from $3,650; net-a-porter.com\n\n\n\nCourtesy Matches Fashion\n\n\n\nAgent Provocateur Classic Silk-satin Pyjama Trousers\n\n\"If what we wear really does say something about who we are, then my usual loungewear (men\u2019s basketball shorts, oversized sweatshirts, Crocs) needs a serious reboot. Enter Agent Provocateur\u2019s silk pajama set: luxurious and sexy, yet oh-so-comfortable.\"\n\nErin Lengas, Editorial Operations Associate\n\nTo buy: $163; matchesfashion.com\n\n\n\nCourtesy Silver Mirror\n\n\n\nA Facial at Silver Mirror\n\n\"Silver Mirror has changed the way that I look at getting a facial. This facial bar, with two locations in NYC and a recently opened location in DC, offers a quick and effective way to maintain healthy skin on a regular basis. Choose from their menu of 30 or 50-minute treatments and discuss your skincare concerns and goals with an experienced esthetician to create a customized, targeted facial just for you. Silver Mirror\u2019s philosophy is simple: make taking care of your skin a priority just like we might regularly prioritize getting our hair trimmed, going to the gym, or going to the nail salon. A facial doesn\u2019t always have to be a lengthy, costly event. Even going once will be a treat for anyone on your list. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll help Silver Mirror find their newest regular.\"\n\nHannah Belport, Editorial Operations Coordinator\n\nTo buy: From $83; silvermirror.com", "images":
