Kardashian revealed that she did not extend an invitation to the woman, who\u2019s been kept out of the public eye, during an appearance on \u201cThe Real\u201d to promote her new line of fragrances on Thursday. \u201cI did not,\u201d Kardashian explained when host Loni Love asked whether she invited the surrogate to the party. \u201cI introduced her to my family earlier that day, and I just thought \u2026 I don\u2019t know, it was a weird decision to have to make.\u201d She continued, \u201cOf course I would have wanted her to be there, and be a part of it, but I hadn\u2019t really gone that far in explaining it to my kids yet.\u201d\n\nKardashian already shares two children with West \u2014 daughter North, 4, and Saint, 2 \u2014 whom she felt weren\u2019t ready to understand the surrogate\u2019s role. \u201cI think I have to explain it to my kids first, and figure out how I\u2019m going to explain it to them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I have to figure that out first before they really see, and then if we\u2019re celebrating, you know, her \u2026 I just wanted to celebrate the baby.\u201d The beauty mogul, however, had nothing but praiseworthy things to say about the surrogate, who she revealed didn\u2019t know that she was carrying the celebrity offspring at first. Kardashian said surrogacy can be done anonymously, but the star insisted on meeting to make sure the surrogate was comfortable with the situation. \u201cWhat if they weren\u2019t a fan of me or my husband?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if they didn\u2019t want to be carrying our baby? I wanted to give them that choice.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 3, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nA post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 9, 2017
