Nick Spicher used the word \u201cgangster\u201d in a response when \u201cgangsta\u201d was the correct word. Associated Press file\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a gangster and a gangsta? On a popular television game show, it\u2019s $3,200.\n\n\u201cJeopardy!\u201d contestant Nick Spicher found out the hard way. During an episode which aired Monday, he used the wrong word with his question about Coolio\u2019s \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise,\u201d the rapper\u2019s hit song for \u201cDangerous Minds,\u201d a 1995 movie starring Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nLet Nick\u2019s mistake be a lesson to us all.

It was initially ruled correct, earning Spicher $1,600.\n\nThe prize was short-lived. Host Alex Trebek later announced that the judges ruled Spicher\u2019s incorrect because he used \u201cgangster\u201d instead of \u201cgangsta\u201d in his response.\n\nThe show\u2019s judges explained why the money was taken away on its website, noting that the two words are unique in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nDespite the loss in winnings, the museum educator from Everett, Wash., left as the day\u2019s champion, winning $15,201. He would lose the next day, finishing second to Saralee Etter, a writer from Pataskala, Ohio.\n\nWhile the judges ruled against him, the rapper said he likely would not have.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with TMZ, Coolio said he \u201cprobably would have gave it to him\u201d but served notice to white people: \u201cThe E-R will always get you in trouble.\u201d\n\nSpicher explained his side of things on his Twitter page, saying he hopes \u201cit blows over soon\u201d and telling everyone to \u201cstay gangsta.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/mcclatchydc/logo-impact.svg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/p9ko10/picture237888529/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/People_Gabrielle_Union_71149.jpg", "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/xsj807/picture237953669/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Misty_Copeland_63583.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ew72ve/picture237949919/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/APTOPIX_Britain_Soccer_Premier_League_67181.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/ndcgbv/picture192886514/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP_17279548379166", "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/6j8to2/picture237972779/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Media-CBS-O%E2%80%99Donnell_74656.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/ndcgbv/picture192886514/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP_17279548379166", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Seth Wenig", "Andrew Dalton", "Ap Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/article192886519.html", "title": "'Jeopardy!' contestant docked for using gangster, not gangsta", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/sacbee/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "sacbee_news", "title": "\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 contestant learns costly difference between gangster and gangsta", "description": "\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 contestant Nick Spicher lost $3,200 on an episode that aired Monday, January 1, when he said \u201cgangster\u201d when referring to Coolio\u2019s song \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise.\u201d", "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/ndcgbv/picture192886514/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP_17279548379166"}, "og": {"site_name": "sacbee", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 contestant learns costly difference between gangster and gangsta", "url": "https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/tv/article192886519.html", "description": "\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 contestant Nick Spicher lost $3,200 on an episode that aired Monday, January 1, when he said \u201cgangster\u201d when referring to Coolio\u2019s song \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise.\u201d", "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/ndcgbv/picture192886514/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP_17279548379166"}, "fb": {"app_id": 832188313608327, "pages": 21595906224}, "title": "'Jeopardy!' contestant docked for using gangster, not gangsta | The Sacramento Bee", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "\u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 contestant Nick Spicher lost $3,200 on an episode that aired Monday, January 1, when he said \u201cgangster\u201d when referring to Coolio\u2019s song \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise.\u201d", "keywords": "jeopardy, nick spicher, gangsta's paradise, coolio, question, answer, judges, alex trebek, show, tv, game", "news_keywords": "jeopardy, nick spicher, gangsta's paradise, coolio, question, answer, judges, alex trebek, show, tv, game", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "original-source": "http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/article192886519.html", "google-site-verification": "Q9gAoI5aCJRTixPw10OshUcjq4BF49M__7o-TS4M3zc", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=382902278, affiliate-data=at=1010lHsN&ct=SmartAppBannerSAC, app-argument=https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/tv/article192886519.html?appNav=smartBanner", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"192886519\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.sacbee.com", "summary": ""}
