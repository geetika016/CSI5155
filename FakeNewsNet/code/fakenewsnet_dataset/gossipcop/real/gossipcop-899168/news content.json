The 43-year-old athlete recently spoke with Access Hollywood and gushed that the gifts that he likes to give to his girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, for Christmas are the ones that come from the heart.\n\n\u201cIt has to be something creative. I can\u2019t just go out and buy something expensive. For Jennifer, something that is handwritten or maybe is a photo,\u201d he shared, adding that he has something creative in mind for her this year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give any secrets away for this holiday. It\u2019s something that is heartfelt. It is something that resembles a memory that we\u2019ve had together that involves our children or involves our home.\u201d Aww!\n\nGetty Images\n\nJennifer is sure to get the surprise of a lifetime once she sees Alex\u2019s gift. \u201cUltimately, that\u2019s what it is all about,\u201d Alex gushed of gifting J.Lo the creative present.\n\nThis year, Jennifer and her boyfriend are planning to follow tradition by taking their kids to give back to children in need. \u201cI think the holiday season is really about giving back. One of the things that we mandate for our kids, all four of them, is to go into the Boys and Girls Club, go into the inner city \u2014 whether it\u2019s Thanksgiving or Christmas \u2014 and they have to give back,\u201d the doting dad explained. \u201cOne Christmas we made it where they only got one gift and all the gifts that were supposed to go to them, they donated to people who couldn\u2019t really afford it. I think it\u2019s really important for our children.\u201d\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images for Caesars Entertainment\n\nSince Alex and J.Lo didn\u2019t grow up very wealthy, they don\u2019t want to spoil their children by giving them everything that they never had as kids. Alex said that since his two girls, Natasha, 14, and Ella, 10, know the importance of giving back during the holidays, \u201cthey don\u2019t ask for too much,\u201d he said.\n\nHis daughters and J.Lo\u2019s 10-year-old twins, Maximilian and Emme, are \u201cgrateful for everything they get.\u201d So this year, he and Jennifer plan on giving their blended family a really special Christmas!",
