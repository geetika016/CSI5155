Also present were the Bleachers' Jack Antonoff, Broadway actor Ben Platt, and \"Perfect\" singer Ed Sheeran. He and Swift performed \"End Game\" together on the Jingle Ball stage.\n\nBefore Swift hit the stage, the audience got a huge surprise from guests Katie Holmes and daughter Suri Cruise. The duo introduced the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" singer as one of their favorite performers, to the delight of fans.\n\nOther acts who performed at the Jingle Ball include Niall Horn, Julia Michaels, Charlie Puth, The Chainsmokers, Demi Lovato, Sam Smith, and more.\n\nThe 26-year-old pop singer and the 26-year-old actor have yet to confirm their relationship, despite being in the rumor mill for the past six months.\n\nIf Swift's songs in her recently released album \"Reputation\" will be the basis, however, the hit maker as good as confirmed the reports. The lyrics of her third single, \"Gorgeous,\" in particular, leaves many hints at her relationship with her British beau.", "images": ["https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78319/lilian-maria-kurz.png?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/77516/marriage.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/61862/corbyn.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78334/dreams.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/77695/st-pauls-cathedral.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=72&r=57", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/76652/lgbtq.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/78358/keith-waters.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20015427&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/68363/taylor-swift.jpg", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78329/chick-fil-a.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.christiantoday_com,DomainId.120718", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/62149/richard-dawkins.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78330/choir.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://go.ezoic.net/utilcave_com/img/ezoic.png", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/78184/church-of-england.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=59&r=55", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/77796/school.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78325/i-see-you.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/58807/rabbi-cohen.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/78356/nativity.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78322/nativity.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-29b4.kxcdn.com/assets/img/logo-footer.png", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/img/logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/68363/taylor-swift.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://christiantoday.com/article/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-news-rumored-couple-rendezvous-after-jingle-ball-concert/121058.htm", "title": "Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn news: Rumored couple rendezvous after Jingle Ball concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Taylor Swift news,taylor swift joe alwyn rumors,taylor swift joe alwyn in nyc,jingle ball concert,taylor swift jingle ball,jatie holmes suri jungle ball", "description": "Taylor Swift and her rumored boyfriend were spotted walking hand-in-hand in New York City after the singer attended the Jingle Ball Concert on Friday, Dec. 8.", "msvalidate.01": "2770D3F1DEB25A5BF965224150B525F4", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "p": {"domain_verify": "edb0984d11c94fc2828120186bade850"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.christiantoday.com/article/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-news-rumored-couple-rendezvous-after-jingle-ball-concert/121058.htm", "title": "Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn news: Rumored couple rendezvous after Jingle Ball concert", "type": "article", "description": "Taylor Swift and her rumored boyfriend were spotted walking hand-in-hand in New York City after the singer attended the Jingle Ball Concert on Friday, Dec. 8.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/68363/taylor-swift.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "fb": {"app_id": 105496396833914, "pages": 188340264915}, "cmc": {"type": 5}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianToday", "title": "Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn news: Rumored couple rendezvous after Jingle Ball concert", "description": "Taylor Swift and her rumored boyfriend were spotted walking hand-in-hand in New York City after the singer attended the Jingle Ball Concert on Friday, Dec. 8.", "image": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/68363/taylor-swift.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512990180.0, "source": "https://www.christiantoday.com", "summary": ""}
