Her beau complemented her look in a light gray button-down shirt and skinny jeans.\n\nBackgrid\n\nThe Italian eatery seems to be a favorite for Bullock and Randall. Just last week, the two were spotted packing on the PDA after leaving the restaurant for lunch.\n\nAlthough Aniston's husband, Justin Theroux, was seemingly absent from dinner on Saturday, these two couples are no strangers to double date nights. The foursome was first spotted together in September 2015, enjoying dinner at Bullock's restaurant, Bess Bistro, in Austin, Texas.\n\nHear more in the video below!\n\nSandra Bullock and Boyfriend Bryan Randall Pack on the PDA -- See the Pic!
