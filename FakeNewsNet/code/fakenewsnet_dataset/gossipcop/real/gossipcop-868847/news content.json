It didn't mean that any love was lost, or that they lost any feelings for one another, but they both have realized that they love each other and want to be with one another.\"\n\nIn mid-April, the pair announced via a statement from their rep that they had called off their engagement. \"After much contemplation and six years of being together Nikki Bella and John Cena announced today their decision to separate as a couple,\" the statement read. In a follow-up joint statement from Cena and Bella, the pair wrote, \"While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.\"\n\nFollowing the news of the split, reports surfaced that a main cause of the breakup was Cena's reluctance to have children. But earlier this month, Cena appeared on the Today show and reversed his stance on starting a family, saying, \"I still love Nicole, I would love to marry Nicole, I still would love to have a family with Nicole. It was an unfortunate set of circumstances where our relationship ended.\" He continued, \"I love her. I want to be with her. I want to make her my wife. I want to be the father of her children. I just want us to work.\" Though all Bella said in an interview hours later was that she was \"speechless\" over Cena's words, the pair were spotted walking together in San Diego less than a week later.", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/tE2sF3uZfNM9ndBOq698q5ba8qQ=/2224x1251/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5b106298c546e62bc1b4e9c1__169-f31e830af76444459371d8801233e50a.jpeg", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/tE2sF3uZfNM9ndBOq698q5ba8qQ=/2224x1251/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5b106298c546e62bc1b4e9c1__169-f31e830af76444459371d8801233e50a.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/john-cena-nikki-bella-back-together", "title": "John Cena and Nikki Bella Are Reportedly Back Together a Few Weeks After Calling Off Their Wedding", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Approximately six weeks after they called off their engagement, John Cena and Nikki Bella have reportedly reunited and are back together, sources say", "sailthru.tags": "brides,news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/john-cena-nikki-bella-back-together", "title": "John Cena and Nikki Bella Are Reportedly Back Together a Few Weeks After Calling Off Their Wedding", "description": "Approximately six weeks after they called off their engagement, John Cena and Nikki Bella have reportedly reunited and are back together, sources say", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/tE2sF3uZfNM9ndBOq698q5ba8qQ=/2224x1251/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5b106298c546e62bc1b4e9c1__169-f31e830af76444459371d8801233e50a.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "John Cena and Nikki Bella Are Reportedly Back Together a Few Weeks After Calling Off Their Wedding", "description": "Approximately six weeks after they called off their engagement, John Cena and Nikki Bella have reportedly reunited and are back together, sources say", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/-J_6LpZ5tiK9c9UvVCB_v07QqAU=/2238x2238/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5b106298c546e62bc1b4e9c1__11-6b7db4b47f2a41fd95456a847e94a993.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
