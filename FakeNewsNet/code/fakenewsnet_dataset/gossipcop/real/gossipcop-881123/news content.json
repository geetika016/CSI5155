And this year\u2019s show didn\u2019t disappoint, with some of the most glammed up red carpet moments of the year.\n\nWhile we doubt any of the celebs did their own makeup in the back of an Uber on the way, the products used to create their looks are surprisingly affordable.\n\nIn fact, most of them cost less than your favourite bottle of sav blanc.\n\nGina Rodriguez\n\nThis hairspray has been a staple since day dot and for good reason. The formula tames flyaways and provides lasting hold, which is probably why hairstylist Kristin Heitkotter used it on Rodriguez's low ponytail.\n\nL'Oreal Paris Elnett Satin Hairspray Extra Strong Hold, $10.99\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nTo give Union natural-looking brows, makeup artist Fiona Stiles brushed on this clear brow gel to keep them from going rogue.\n\nTweezerman Browmousse, $25.95\n\nZoe Kravitz\n\nHairstylist Nikki Nelms got her hair inspiration from Kravitz's layered dress, starting the style with Dove's dry shampoo to simultaneously cleanse and add volume.\n\nDove Hair Therapy Refresh + Care Dry Shampoo, $9.99\n\nMandy Moore\n\nSidestepping the neutral lip trend, Moore went for a bold, fuchsia shade that will sell anyone on thinking pink. To get a long-lasting finish, makeup artist Jenn Streicher applied one layer, blotted it off, then added another coat.\n\nLaura Mercier Velour Lovers Lip Colour in French Kiss, $40\n\nAriel Winter\n\nStylist Charles Dujic used this hairspray based in coconut oil and shea butter to create volume while flat ironing her slicked-back hair.\n\nMarc Anthony Hydrating Coconut Oil & Shea Butter Volume Hairspray, $6.99\n\nEmmys 2017 Best Dressed -JS Emmys 2017 Best Dressed -JS\n\nAshleigh Austen is whimn.com.au's lifestyle editor and writes about everything from way-out wellness trends and workouts to genius beauty hacks and bang-on fashion buys.
