If so, you probably saw Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o.\n\nThe actress stopped by this year\u2019s Comic-Con to tease the upcoming Black Panther movie and debut some top-secret new footage, but apparently, when she wasn\u2019t on stage in Hall H, she donned some pink spandex and took to the convention floor.\n\nNyong\u2019o later shared a joyful video of her undercover antics on Twitter, set to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201ci,\u201d showing the actress dancing across the hall floor, posing with fellow cosplayers, and tracking down a Maz Kanata figurine. (Nyong\u2019o voices the elderly alien in The Force Awakens.)\n\nNyong\u2019o stars in Black Panther as Nakia, a covert agent from the fictional nation of Wakanda, and she and her costars \u2014 including Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker, Letitia Wright, Michael B. Jordan, Winston Duke, and Andy Serkis \u2014 received a standing ovation when they premiered new footage from the upcoming superhero flick.
