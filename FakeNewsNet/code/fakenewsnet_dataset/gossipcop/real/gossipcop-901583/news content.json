She is divorced from Thomas Markle, according to The Sun.\n\nShe is perhaps best known for playing Rachel Zane, an ambitious legal associate on the TV show \u201cSuits.\u201d Her acting career before then included parts in shows like \u201cFringe,\u201d \u201cKnight Rider,\u201d and \u201cCastle\u201d and in the films \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d and \u201cGet Him to the Greek.\u201d\n\nIn addition to acting, Markle co-founded and edited a lifestyle website called The Tig, which closed down in April of 2017. \u201cKeep finding those Tig moments of discovery, keep laughing and taking risks, and keep being \u2018the change you wish to see in the world,\u2019\u201d she wrote on the site\u2019s farewell message.\n\nMarkle has also performed humanitarian work as a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, and has traveled to Rwanda in support of clean water initiatives. She has also done work for One Young World, a U.K. based charity that brings world leaders together as \u201ccounselors\u201d to address global issues.\n\nCongratulations to #OYW Counsellor & friend @meghanmarkle on her wonderful engagement news with HRH Prince Harry!

Prince Harry asked for some privacy on Twitter a year ago, saying that \u201ca line has been crossed\u201d and that Markle had been \u201csubject to a wave of abuse and harassment.\u201d The statement mentioned that the criticism had \u201cracial undertones\u201d as well (Markle described herself as mixed-race in a 2015 editorial for ELLE).\n\nKensington Palace has issued a statement this morning about the harassment currently being experienced by Meghan Markle and her family. pic.twitter.com/EuFZ4fmUIj \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) November 8, 2016\n\nThe Prince of Wales said the wedding is scheduled to happen in spring of 2018. It will be the first royal wedding since Prince William and Kate Middleton married in 2011.\n\nThis will be the second marriage for Markle, who was divorced from producer Trevor Engelson in 2013 after two years of marriage. Harry\u2019s father, Prince Charles of Wales, was divorced from Princess Diana in 1996. Charles later married Camilla Parker Bowles, who had also been divorced.\n\nKensington Palace released a statement Monday saying that Prince Harry had asked Markle\u2019s parents for permission to wed their daughter. \u201cWe are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy to us as parents.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/w58kyi/picture237979379/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP19335779609675%20(1).jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557045001/735e80d4-e684-49b6-8efa-0fb7c5b484c6/5bde77b7-b703-41d0-a7ef-2e91bef81bda/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557045001/2fd0c3a3-535c-4191-8722-c5e7643973fe/aefe1a3b-1004-4665-a47c-4e17a99336f3/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/mcclatchydc/logo-impact.svg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/xv934k/picture237184493/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/newsom_HSRTHUMB.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/8wye60/picture237969164/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP_16238594074865.jpg", "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/hw8dyk/picture237632604/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/newsomTHUMB_01.jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557042001/267ef186-d4e0-47cd-926a-e28a10e00419/ef9abbed-247d-436e-b057-2bfe312e6ac0/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/incoming/3soybs/picture237980289/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/EKy3RpxWkAAEf6S.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557045001/735e80d4-e684-49b6-8efa-0fb7c5b484c6/5bde77b7-b703-41d0-a7ef-2e91bef81bda/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Berson"], "canonical_link": "http://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/news/nation-world/world/article186648248.html", "title": "Who is Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9e?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/sacbee/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "sacbee_news", "title": "Who is Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9e?", "description": "Prince Harry of Wales is engaged to girlfriend Meghan Markle, an American actress.
