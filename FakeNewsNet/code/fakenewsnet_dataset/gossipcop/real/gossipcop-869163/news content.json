But did I really get it right? Now, with National Geographic and with the latest research, science and technology, I\u2019m going to reassess.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Highest Grossing Blockbusters of All Time\n\nSet to premiere in December, the project will use new technology to analyze the critical choices made during the production, go inside Cameron\u2019s personal journey while making the film, and follow the director and a team of experts to a Titanic exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, NatGeo ordered a series from fellow Titanic alum Leonardo DiCaprio. And making it the Titanic trifecta, DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are currently auctioning off a dinner with themselves for charity. So naturally, keep your eyes out for Billy Zane news.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/msdtita_ec034_h.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5ef8613926fe5ac5d5623868eca6ee9f?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/msdtita_ec034_h.jpg?crop=0px%2C277px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/msdtita_ec034_h.jpg?crop=0px%2C277px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/25/james-cameron-nat-geo-titanic-20th-anniversary-documentary/", "title": "James Cameron and NatGeo set sail on Titanic: 20th Anniversary documentary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "James Cameron, NatGeo, Titanic, Titanic: 20th Anniversary", "news_keywords": "James Cameron, NatGeo, Titanic, Titanic: 20th Anniversary", "description": "The Oscar winning director will re-check the authenticity of his film with the help of new technology.", "og": {"title": "James Cameron and NatGeo Set Sail on 'Titanic: 20th Anniversary' Documentary", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/25/james-cameron-nat-geo-titanic-20th-anniversary-documentary/", "description": "James Cameron is set to dive back into the story of the Titanic.
