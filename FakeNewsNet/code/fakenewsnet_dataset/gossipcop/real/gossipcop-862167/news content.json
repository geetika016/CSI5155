Jolie spoke to the peacekeepers present, giving a speech highlighting how they are at the forefront of the fight against sexual violence.\n\nImage zoom\n\n\u201cThe reality is that women and girls, as well as men and boys, can still be raped with near-total impunity in conflict zones around the world,\u201d Jolie, 42, said in a speech exclusively obtained by PEOPLE. \u201cThe reality is that a peacekeeper may be the first person one of those traumatized girls encounters after their abuse. As peacekeepers you need to be absolutely clear what to do, because that girl will be frightened, especially of a man with a gun. How do you approach her, will affect her whether she is able to begin to recover or if more damage will be done.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Mark Henley/UNHCR\n\nJolie meeting with survivors in Kenya\n\nJolie started the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative in 2012 alongside former Foreign Secretary Lord William Hague of Richmond. Since its founding, the program has trained over 17,000 military and police personnel on sexual violence issues, and the PSVI team of experts has been deployed more than eight times.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie-21.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie1.jpg?crop=92px%2C23px%2C1666px%2C875px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie1.jpg?crop=92px%2C23px%2C1666px%2C875px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ale Russian"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/human-interest/angelina-jolie-visits-kenya-humanitarian-trip-survivors-sexual-violence/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Visits Kenya on Humanitarian Trip Condemning Sexual Violence as She Meets Young Survivors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "angelina jolie, angelina jolie activist, angelina jolie psvi, angelina jolie kenya", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie, angelina jolie activist, angelina jolie psvi, angelina jolie kenya", "description": "Angelina Jolie traveled to Kenya to see firsthand how her initiative against sexual violence is working", "og": {"title": "Angelina Jolie Visits Kenya on Humanitarian Trip Condemning Sexual Violence as She Meets Young Survivors", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/angelina-jolie-visits-kenya-humanitarian-trip-survivors-sexual-violence/", "description": "Angelina Jolie traveled to Kenya to see firsthand how her initiative against sexual violence is working", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie1.jpg?crop=92px%2C23px%2C1666px%2C875px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/human-interest/angelina-jolie-visits-kenya-humanitarian-trip-survivors-sexual-violence/", "description": "Angelina Jolie traveled to Kenya to see firsthand how her initiative against sexual violence is working", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie1.jpg?crop=92px%2C23px%2C1666px%2C875px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/angelina-jolie-visits-kenya-humanitarian-trip-survivors-sexual-violence/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Visits Kenya on Humanitarian Trip Condemning Sexual Violence as She Meets Young Survivors", "description": "Angelina Jolie traveled to Kenya to see firsthand how her initiative against sexual violence is working", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/angelina-jolie1.jpg?crop=92px%2C23px%2C1666px%2C875px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
