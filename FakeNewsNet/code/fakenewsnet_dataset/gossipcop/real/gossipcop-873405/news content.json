But on the reunion, Luann showed a more vulnerable side \u2014 admitting that it alarms her to hear the constant rumors.\n\nAsked what she would do if those claims ended up having validity, Luann gave a swift answer.\n\n\u201cI would definitely leave,\u201d she said in a clip of the reunion released Wednesday morning. \u201cI would. After I kill him. I\u2019d kill him first and then I\u2019d leave. You can push me so far but once you push me over the line\u2026\u201d\n\nImage zoom Luann D'Agostino Bravo\n\nSaid allegations appeared to be true only once, when Tom, 50, was caught by a friend of costar Bethenny Frankel\u2019s kissing a mysterious blonde at The Regency Hotel the day before their engagement party. Luann forgave her then-finac\u00e9 and has maintained he\u2019s been faithful since their lavish New Years Eve ceremony in Palm Beach \u2014 despite his flirtatious personality and \u201chot mic\u201d moments on the show (including a scene in which he referred to himself as a \u201cdog with a collar\u201d while chatting with an ex at a party).\n\n\u201cI admit his humor is a little off,\u201d Luann said on the reunion, indicating that she understood how Tom \u2014 who was a lifelong bachelor before they wed \u2014 came off on the show.\n\nImage zoom Tom and Luann D'Agostino Robin Marchant/Getty\n\nThe reality star also revealed that she did not have an open relationship with Tom, telling Cohen, \u201cI\u2019m not interesting in an open relationship otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be married.\u201d\n\nHer comments may not have convinced her RHONY costars. \u201cYou stayed with Alex all those years,\u201d Sonja Morgan said of Luann\u2019s first husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, whom Luann had previously said cheated on her.\n\n\u201cWell, that was different,\u201d said Luann. \u201cYou see we were separated and I didn\u2019t really want anyone to know.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Highlights from Luann de Lesseps & Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr.\u2019s Wedding\n\nLuann announced on Twitter Aug. 3 that she and Tom were divorcing. \u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDays later, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful.\n\n\u201cI do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,\u201d Luann told Page Six on Aug. 3 when asked the reasons for their divorce. \u201cGod knows he\u2019s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don\u2019t believe that continued [while we were married].\u201d\n\n\u201dIt was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it. But the truth is we just weren\u2019t getting along.\u201d\n\nPart 1 of The Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/luann-tom-dagostino.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-15-at-9-07-08-pm.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-15-at-9-07-08-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2552px%2C1339.8px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-15-at-9-07-08-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2552px%2C1339.8px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/luann-dagostino-tom-dagostino-cheating-real-housewives-reunion/", "title": "Luann D'Agostino Addressed Tom's Cheating 3 Weeks Before Divorce: 'I'd Kill Him First & Then I'd Leave'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "RHONY Reunion, Real Housewives of New York City Reunion, Luann D'Agostino, Luann D'Agostino Tom D'Agostino, Luann Tom D'Agostino cheating, Luann de Lesseps, Tom D'Agostino cheating", "news_keywords": "RHONY Reunion, Real Housewives of New York City Reunion, Luann D'Agostino, Luann D'Agostino Tom D'Agostino, Luann Tom D'Agostino cheating, Luann de Lesseps, Tom D'Agostino cheating", "description": "Luann D'Agostino opened up about Tom D'Agostino's alleged infidelities three weeks before they split, saying on the Real Housewives of New York City reunion that she'd \"definitely leave\" him if they were true", "og": {"title": "Luann D'Agostino Addressed Tom's Cheating 3 Weeks Before Divorce: 'I'd Kill Him First & Then I'd Leave'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/luann-dagostino-tom-dagostino-cheating-real-housewives-reunion/", "description": "Luann D'Agostino opened up about Tom D'Agostino's alleged infidelities three weeks before they split, saying on the Real Housewives of New York City reunion that she'd \"definitely leave\" him if they were true", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-15-at-9-07-08-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2552px%2C1339.8px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/luann-dagostino-tom-dagostino-cheating-real-housewives-reunion/", "description": "Luann D'Agostino opened up about Tom D'Agostino's alleged infidelities three weeks before they split, saying on the Real Housewives of New York City reunion that she'd \"definitely leave\" him if they were true", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-15-at-9-07-08-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2552px%2C1339.8px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/luann-dagostino-tom-dagostino-cheating-real-housewives-reunion/", "title": "Luann D'Agostino Addressed Tom's Cheating 3 Weeks Before Divorce: 'I'd Kill Him First & Then I'd Leave'", "description": "Luann D'Agostino opened up about Tom D'Agostino's alleged infidelities three weeks before they split, saying on the Real Housewives of New York City reunion that she'd \"definitely leave\" him if they were true", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-15-at-9-07-08-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2552px%2C1339.8px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
