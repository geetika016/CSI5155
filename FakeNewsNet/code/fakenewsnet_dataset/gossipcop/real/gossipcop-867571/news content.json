The two pose around life-size versions of the fashion house\u2019s new monogram logo, \u201cF is Fendi,\u201d in the playful (yet super-luxe) Karl Lagerfeld-shot photo series.\n\nWhether they\u2019re twinning in jewel-toned dresses or showing off the brand\u2019s latest and greatest sheer organza evening wear and winter-ready coats, we can\u2019t help but dream of what fall fashion has in store for us\u2014even if we\u2019re deep into summer. Oh, and those colorful F hoop earrings? They\u2019d send any logo enthusiast\u2019s heart aflutter. Hair extraordinaire Sam McKnight kept Jenner\u2019s locks sleek and straight and gave Hadid a retro-inspired \u2018do, while both sported smoldering makeup by Peter Phillips. (Thanks to them, we now know what our go-to fall beauty looks will be.)\n\nBut really, what\u2019s a bigger BFF milestone than starring alongside your pal in a luxury fashion campaign? If they weren't considered fashion icons before, they certainly are now.\n\nClick through the gallery below to check out the campaign in full.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?cv=2.0&cj=1&c1=2&c2=17186550&c6=Fashion&c8=BFFs+Kendall+And+Gigi+Just+Scored+A+New+Fashion+Campaign", "https://nylon-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rebelmouse.io%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xODQzMDk3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU3NTc0ODE1MH0.Inv4PupBOQNZwRd7TJ8sX-CzTyaP44V_ZP8-jn-CvUc%2Fimg.jpg%3Fwidth%3D980/2000%2C2000/GgV4VXGD%2BQFACylk/img.jpg"], "top_img": "https://nylon-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rebelmouse.io%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xODQzMDk3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU3NTc0ODE1MH0.Inv4PupBOQNZwRd7TJ8sX-CzTyaP44V_ZP8-jn-CvUc%2Fimg.jpg%3Fwidth%3D980/2000%2C2000/GgV4VXGD%2BQFACylk/img.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Igneri"], "canonical_link": "https://nylon.com/articles/kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid-fendi-fall-2017", "title": "BFFs Kendall And Gigi Just Scored A New Fashion Campaign", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@", "image": "https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xODQzMDk3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU3NTc0ODE1MH0.Inv4PupBOQNZwRd7TJ8sX-CzTyaP44V_ZP8-jn-CvUc/img.jpg?width=980&1575306382"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1332028133512923}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://nylon.com/articles/kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid-fendi-fall-2017", "site_name": "NYLON", "image": {"identifier": "https://nylon-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rebelmouse.io%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xODQzMDk3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU3NTc0ODE1MH0.Inv4PupBOQNZwRd7TJ8sX-CzTyaP44V_ZP8-jn-CvUc%2Fimg.jpg%3Fwidth%3D980/2000%2C2000/GgV4VXGD%2BQFACylk/img.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 2000}, "title": "BFFs Kendall And Gigi Just Scored A New Fashion Campaign", "description": "\u201cF is Fendi\u201d"}, "article": {"section": "Fashion", "publisher": 60772646764, "published_time": "2017-07-17T17:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-11-08T18:04:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/60772646764"}, "referrer": "always", "theme-color": "#647187", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "keywords": "fashion, fendi, gigi hadid, kendall jenner, news", "description": "\u201cF is Fendi\u201d"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500310800.0, "source": "https://nylon.com", "summary": ""}
