Pixar Pier also introduces four new neighborhoods representing Pixar stories. This artist concept captures a scene from one of the neighborhoods inspired by The Incredibles.\n\nOne of Disney California Adventure\u2019s most popular rides will soon be gone \u2013 or at least transformed.\n\nThe Anaheim amusement park adjacent to Disneyland is getting a makeover, and the California Screamin\u2019 roller coaster along Paradise Pier will close Jan. 8, according to a Disney news release posted Thursday. It will be remade into a roller coaster based on \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d that will open next summer.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a transformation that will permanently change Paradise Pier into Pixar Pier, an area with four new neighborhoods. \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d and \u201cToy Story\u201d series as well as \u201cInside Out\u201d each get their own land, while the fourth will be dedicated to other Pixar films and characters, according to the release.\n\nAlso subject to transformation: Mickey\u2019s Fun Wheel, the park\u2019s Ferris wheel, which will be overhauled to include images of Pixar characters. Other attractions being closed for transformation include the boardwalk games, Ariel\u2019s Grotto restaurant and the Cove Bar, according to the release. All close on Jan. 8.\n\nBLACK FRIDAY SALE Get an annual digital subscription for only $20. Act before it's gone!
