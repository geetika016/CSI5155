{"url": "https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-cyber-monday-2018-deals-in-usa", "text": "Black Friday itself might be done and dusted but the best deals for 2019 will continue all weekend, plus Cyber Monday deals are just around the corner. That's good news for anyone late to the sales party as that means there's still a significant amount of savings to be had.\n\nYou'll find those savings everywhere and anywhere, both at big box retailers like Best Buy, Walmart and Target as well as online at Amazon, NewEgg and B&H Photo. There's also a number of smaller stores like Kohl's getting in on the sales and that's only good news for consumers.\n\nSo when does Black Friday well and truly end? Admittedly, some deals were for Black Friday only and sold out within minutes or hours, but many deals started a few days before Black Friday and will continue through to Cyber Monday after Thanksgiving.\n\nThere are many different kinds of deals coming up from laptops to phones to AirPods (although the latter is heading quickly out of stock). We've sadly had little in the way of a cracking Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal, and even the PS4 deals - while they have existed, and haven't been too bad - were more scarce than we expected.\n\nBut, based on what we saw on Friday, there's a lot more to come.\n\n\ud83d\udca1TechRadar's Big Black Friday Tip: Buy it now!\ud83d\udca1 If you're thinking about a deal at the moment, or you're scared it will go cheaper on Cyber Monday, then our advice is simple: if it has a good discount attached to it, go for it! If you later find the product is cheaper elsewhere, you can always buy it again and return the original. Just make sure to check the retailer's terms and conditions for returning items.\n\nIt's basically been Apple products that have been the winners - with $400 cashback on an iPhone 11, lower prices on AirPods and Apple Watches and MacBook / iPads being cheaper than ever before, it's been (and still is) the time to grab yourself a bargain.\n\nThere's more in there too - Dyson has been popular for Black Friday 2019, DNA kits have been a surprise package and we've even seen great discount on power tools as well.\n\nAnyway, enough of telling you what you're getting, and onto the deals themselves - and if you want something more than what we've scavenged from the depths of the web, here are all the top Black Friday sales from around the web first:\n\nAmazon.com: - Black Friday deals now live!\n\n- Black Friday deals now live!
