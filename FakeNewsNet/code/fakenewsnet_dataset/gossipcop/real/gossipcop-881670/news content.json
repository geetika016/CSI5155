Previously, creators The Duffer Brothers suggested they plan for the show to ultimately run for four seasons \u201cand then out.\u201d\n\nThere were also a couple bits of news absent from the announcement: There was no indication of when the show will return, or for how many episodes. Oftentimes such details are omitted from a renewal release, so one shouldn\u2019t make any assumptions. But when Netflix renewed Stranger Things for season 2 in August of last year, the announcement was coupled with a 2017 return date and the episode count. That both pieces of info were absent very likely means those details are still being decided (we\u2019re told season 3 is currently being written, which means production wouldn\u2019t likely start until spring at the earliest).\n\nAnd since the second season of Stranger Things debuted in October and that was 15 months after the first season which debuted in July of 2016 \u2026 you\u2019re seeing where we\u2019re going with this, right? So 2019 could see a Netflix vs. HBO battle royale of Stranger Things vs. Game of Thrones. On the other hand, October was such a perfect fit for the show this year, it would be a bit surprising if Netflix pushed to 2019.\n\nAs for the number of episodes, that\u2019s a point of curiosity as well, since the first season was eight and the second season was upped to nine (arguably, the second season\u2019s storyline would have been stronger if tightened into seven or eight episodes). So it will be interesting to see if Stranger Things sticks to nine, or adjusts again.\n\nUltimately, on both the return date and episode count, Netflix will likely opt for whatever The Duffer Brothers need to make the best season possible.\n\nSo we\u2019ll just leave you with this:\n\nThe news comes on the heels of Netflix announcing the renewal of their other fall sensation, Mindhunter, which received a season 2 pickup.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kids.jpg?crop=124px%2C0px%2C1801px%2C1801px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/a135_c011_01230b_001-1296038_r.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/stranger-things-season-2-ep-9-recap.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/st_203-204_unit_4721r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/stranger-things-season-2-ep-6-recap.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2064'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/st_207-208_unit_0765r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wv_publicity_pre_launch_a_still_11-000001.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/st_205-206_unit_5159r.jpg", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/netflix.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a34_promo_stills_022519.0043_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/stranger-things-steve.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/en-us_st2_darkness_3840x2160_still02.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wv_publicity_pre_launch_a_still_50-000001.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/stranger-things-steve.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd", "Lauren Morgan", "Kelly Connolly", "Derek Lawrence", "David Canfield", "Christian Holub", "Dana Schwartz", "Ariana Bacle"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/01/stranger-things-season-3/", "title": "Stranger Things renewed for season 3.
