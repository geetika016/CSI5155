After going back and forth, Kourtney decided to go, so Kim booked a private jet for them to fly to NYC. But at the last minute \u2014 literally, Kim was sitting on the plane waiting \u2014 Kourtney called and backed out, infuriating her sister.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m indecisive. It\u2019s debilitating,\u201d Kourtney told Khlo\u00e9 when the pair sat down for lunch.\n\nSo, Khlo\u00e9, 32, decided to play a game to try and get Kourtney to make decisions on a whim.\n\n\u201cThis is such a joke,\u201d Kourtney, 38, told the cameras. \u201cNone of this is helpful. I\u2019m getting a headache.\u201d\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the only thing Khlo\u00e9 had planned for her older sister. Later in the episode she took Kourtney to a fire station to take part in some rigorous drills. After the intense trip to the station, Kourtney realized she needed to make some changes.\n\n\u201cI feel like Scott [Disick] and I were very co-dependent and I just would always bounce every idea off of him,\u201d she explained to Kim and Khlo\u00e9. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m just like living a different life now where doing more for myself is like an option and now that I am able to make my own decisions, I want to make the best decisions. Tony Robbins taught me to make decisions from the heart and not from your head \u2026 I want to start listening.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Scott Disick: I Proposed to Kourtney Kardashian With a Ring \u2014 but We \u2018Never Spoke About It Again\u2019", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-k1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-k1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-k1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brittany King"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-living-different-life-now-co-depending-scott-disick/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Is 'Living a Different Life Now' After Co-Depending on Scott Disick", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Keeping Up with the Kardashians recap, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, KUWTK,", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Keeping Up with the Kardashians recap, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, KUWTK,", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "og": {"title": "Kourtney Kardashian Is 'Living a Different Life Now' After Co-Depending on Scott Disick", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-living-different-life-now-co-depending-scott-disick/", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-k1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-living-different-life-now-co-depending-scott-disick/", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-k1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-living-different-life-now-co-depending-scott-disick/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Is 'Living a Different Life Now' After Co-Depending on Scott Disick", "description": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-k1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
