And while the rest of the X-Men are present throughout, Sophie Turner\u2019s Jean Grey is at the forefront of the mayhem.\n\nThe photos, published by Entertainment Weekly, give X-Men fans a first look at the next film in the saga, X-Men: Dark Phoenix.\n\nSet almost 10 years after the events of X-Men: Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix is looking to redeem the X-Men universe of the tragedy that was X-Men: The Last Stand (2006); The Last Stand originally acted as a crude adaptation of Marvel\u2019s The Dark Phoenix Saga (1980), which the upcoming Dark Phoenix is based on, as well.\n\nBut just what is this story about? It\u2019s nice of you to ask. In the Dark Phoenix Saga, the X-Men are making their way back to Earth from an off-planet mission and get caught up in a solar flare. Jean Grey (recently portrayed by Turner in the films) sacrifices herself and is exposed to a ridiculous amount of radiation that briefly unlocks her full psychic potential. With this power, she embodies the \u201cPhoenix,\u201d a terrifyingly deadly alter ego without much self-control. Throughout Saga, Phoenix battles the X-Men, commits genocide, and aligns herself with former enemies in order to gain more power.\n\nAs the upcoming Dark Phoenix is expected to emulate the Dark Phoenix Saga, Charles Xavier\u2019s X-Men should probably be on the lookout for a total meltdown.\n\nHere\u2019s, presumably, the event that causes Jean\u2019s transformation above Earth.\n\nJessica Chastain as Lilandra, empress of the Shi\u2019ar Empire.\n\nTurner\u2019s Jean having a quiet moment to herself in the rain.\n\nFans can also look forward to the return of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Mystique, looking more vibrant than ever before.\n\nMichael Fassbender (Magneto) with director Simon Kinberg.\n\nTurner in full Phoenix mode, breaking apart under her own power.\n\nAnd here\u2019s EW\u2019s first-look issue for Dark Phoenix, featuring none other than the titular mutant herself, Jean Grey.\n\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix premieres in theaters on November 2, 2018.", "images":
