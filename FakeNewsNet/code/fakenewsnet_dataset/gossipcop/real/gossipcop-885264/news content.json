I was actually just trying to make something personal and like a diary.\"[6]\n\nSingles [ edit ]\n\n\"Too Good at Goodbyes\" was released as the album's lead single on 8 September 2017. It topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[3]\n\n\"One Last Song\" was sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2017, on the day of album release as its second single.[7][8]\n\nOn 27 March 2018, Smith announced that \"Pray\" would serve as the third single, and would feature newly recorded guest vocals from American rapper Logic. The song was released on 29 March 2018.[9]\n\n\"Baby, You Make Me Crazy\" was released as the fourth single from the album on 29 June 2018.\n\nPromotional singles [ edit ]\n\nOn 6 October 2017, Smith released \"Pray\", a gospel-tinged ballad in collaboration with Timbaland, prompted by time spent in Iraq with the charity War Child as a promotional single from the album.[3][10] Another promotional single, \"Burning\", was released on 27 October 2017.[11]\n\nTour [ edit ]\n\nWithin releasing \"Pray\" as the promotional single on 6 October 2017, The Thrill of It All Tour was announced firstly revealing shows in Europe and North America. It began on 20 March 2018 in Sheffield, England, and concluded on 18 April 2019 in Cape Town, South Africa. In December 2018, Billboard concluded that after 94 shows, Smith grossed $86.1 million and sold 1.07 million tickets on The Thrill of It All Tour.[12] It pushed their career total gross to $102.7 million from 1.4 million tickets sold.[12]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe Thrill of It All received generally positive reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews.[14]\n\nNeil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the album four stars, and was highly positive about it and Smith's vocals, calling them \"supernatural\" and saying: \"The Thrill of It All doesn't just wallow in love's misery, it practically drowns in the stuff. Its 10 songs are almost unrelentingly miserable, self-absorbed and self-pitying, verging on the lachrymose and sentimental (as lovers in the midst of a break-up often are). The instrumentation is understated piano and strings blended with just the occasional hint of contemporary hip-hop effects. At times, Smith's lyrics display a slightly clunking prosaicness. There's not much poetry in lines such as 'real love is never a waste of time' or 'there\u2019' no insurance to pay for the damage'. Yet it all hits home, because Smith makes every note sound like a matter of life and death. 'Him' is the album\u2019s centrepiece, a gospel drama addressed to a judgmental 'father', insisting on Smith's right to love whom they choose. It is a kind of hymn to Him, and as the choir powers up it gains a righteous glory.\"[16] Andy Gill from The Independent also gave a four-star review, and shared in the positivity about the album, remarking: \"Smith's voice remains a thing of wonder throughout\".[19]\n\nWill Hermes for Rolling Stone also gave a positive four-star review, and said: \"Doubling down on his magnificent, gender-nonconforming voice while pushing his songcraft forward, Smith's second LP knights one of the mightiest, most expressive vocalists of his generation.\"[23] In another positive review Nick Levine from NME compared Smith to Adele in his review of the album, stating: \"Both have become enormously successful by singing emotional ballads that connect with huge numbers of people, and both are understandably reluctant to raise the tempo as a result. But like Adele's 25, this is an undeniably accomplished album that will, deservedly, shift a helluva lot of copies.[20] AllMusic's Andy Kellman was positive too in his three and a half-star review, and opined: \"this album maintains a consistency and intensity that places it slightly above the debut.\"[15]\n\nSome reviews were more negative. Though making it his album of the week and giving it three stars, Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was more mixed in his review, writing: \"There\u2019s a certain power to \"The Thrill of It All\" but it could have been a much more potent album if they\u2019d laid off the polish just a little.\"[18] Kitty Empire from The Observer was less enthusiastic in a more negative two-star review, claiming Smith was \"moping by numbers\" like Adele, and surmised: \"There is little drama here, just plenty of shorthand (sad pianos), a total absence of risk\"[21]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nPublication Accolade Rank Ref.
