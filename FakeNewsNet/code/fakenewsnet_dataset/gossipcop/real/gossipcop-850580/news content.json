{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Music_Award", "text": "The Billboard Music Award is an honor given out annually by Billboard, a publication and music popularity chart covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually since 1990 and the event was formerly held in December[1] until it went dormant in 2006. The awards returned in 2011 and are now held annually in May as the third of the Big Three major music awards (among the American Music Awards in the Fall, and the Grammy Awards in the Winter).\n\nAwards process [ edit ]\n\nUnlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Billboard Music Awards finalists are based on album and digital songs sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement. These measurements are tracked year-round by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen Music and Next Big Sound. The 2018 awards are based on the reporting period of April 8, 2017 through March 31, 2018.[2] Awards are given for the top album, artist and single in a number of different music genres.\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\n[7] This field shows winners of \"Artist of the Year\" (awarded from 1995 to 2006), and \"Top Artist\" (awarded since 2011). Whitney Houston won the award for \"#1 World Artist\".This field shows winners of \"Artist of the Year\" (awarded from 1995 to 2006), and \"Top Artist\" (awarded since 2011).\n\nBest Gypsy Song\n\nCategories [ edit ]\n\nFrom 1989 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to \"Top [award title]\". The \"of the year\" portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both \"crossover\" awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued. As of 2017, there are two fan-voted categories.\n\nCurrent categories [ edit ]\n\nThe general categories are Top Artist, Top Billboard 200 Album, Top Hot 100 Song and Top New Artist. These categories highlighted in each award and other categories are divided by genre.\n\nRetired categories (1990\u20132017) [ edit ]\n\nTop Alternative Album\n\nTop Alternative Artist\n\nTop Alternative Song\n\nTop Classical Crossover Artist\n\nTop Classical Crossover Album\n\nTop Country Collaboration (2017)\n\nTop Dance Artist (until 2013)\n\nTop Dance Album (until 2013)\n\nTop Dance Song (until 2013)\n\nTop Digital Media Artist (until 2012)\n\nTop Digital Songs Artist (until 2015)\n\nTop Digital Song (until 2015)\n\nTop EDM Artist (until 2013)\n\nTop EDM Album (until 2013)\n\nTop EDM Song (until 2013)\n\nTop Independent Artists\n\nTop Independent Album\n\nTop Modern Rock Artist\n\nTop Modern Rock Track\n\nTop New Male Artist\n\nTop New Female Artist\n\nTop New Group/Band\n\nTop New Song\n\nTop Pop Song (until 2013)\n\nTop Pop Album (until 2013)\n\nTop Pop Artist (until 2013)\n\nTop Pop Punk Artist\n\nTop Rap Artist (until 2017)\n\nTop R&B Collaboration (2017)\n\nTop Rap Collaboration (2017)\n\nTop Rhythmic Top 40 Title\n\nTop Selling Single\n\nTop Soundtrack Single of the Year\n\nMilestone Award (2013, 2014)", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Billboard-music-awards-logo.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Juice_Wrld_Interview.png/123px-Juice_Wrld_Interview.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Dangerous_Woman_Tour_in_Manchester4_%28cropped%29.jpg/110px-Dangerous_Woman_Tour_in_Manchester4_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/AdamLevine2011.jpg/118px-AdamLevine2011.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/40px-Ambox_current_red.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Drake_at_the_Velvet_Underground_-_2017_%2835986086223%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/121px-Drake_at_the_Velvet_Underground_-_2017_%2835986086223%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Billboard-music-awards-logo.png/200px-Billboard-music-awards-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Billboard-music-awards-logo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Music_Award", "title": "Billboard Music Award", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.5", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Billboard-music-awards-logo.png"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
