{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/dot-eyeliner-instagram-trend", "text": "Dot eyeliner has slowly infiltrated our Instagram feeds, runways, and, most recently, celebrities' lids. When we say slowly, we mean, like, since the '60s. Back when fangirls lined up for the Beatles and women wore white platform boots, Twiggy dotted her lower lash line to emphasize her lashes. A couple decades later, the look hit the runway with a minimalist approach. In 2012, Pat McGrath placed a single cornflower-blue dot in the middle of the lower lash lines of models walking in an Anna Sui show. However, the dot-liner look didn't quite catch on like wildfire the way her glitter lips have. Then, the haute couture version of undereye circles made another appearance on the runway in 2014. Lucia Pieroni created his own version of the look for the Rochas spring/summer 2015 show. History lesson aside, we've been feeling the dot fantasy for years now, so of course we're pumped that beauty bloggers and celebs (like Emma Roberts and Zoe Kravitz) are bringing dot eyeliner into 2017 in a big way. We talked to professional makeup artists to find out how to pull off the look and what tools to use to create perfect little circles.\n\nWhat's the deal with dots?\n\nThe first person we think of when it comes to dot liner is professional makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. She knows firsthand how to make the look incredibly wearable. You can see her mastering the sophisticated spots in up-close selfies on Instagram. She tells Allure that the liner trend is a fun way of mixing up makeup and dots draw attention to your eyes in a new way. \"Lately, people have been embracing details on the lower lash lines,\" she adds. Take the blue waterline trend among celebs lately, for example. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, in particular, has basically taken it on as her signature look.\n\nSave these ideas for later\u2014and follow Allure on Pinterest!\n\nOn Instagram, you may have seen your favorite beauty bloggers create looks inspired by Dominique D'Angelo, a professional makeup artist with about 244,000 followers on Instagram. She tells Allure that not only is dotted liner a way of adding texture to your look in a nontraditional way, it is a \"comfortable step toward wearing something more daring than a classic liner. It can be as bold or as discreet as you'd like.\"\n\nWhat other makeup should you have on when you're wearing dot eyeliner?", "images": ["https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/589cf2dad1f9dd0d0ceee827/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pinnable-3-Dot-Eyeliner-Trend.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/58828054fd6e05e715a9737b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/dot%252520liner%252520comp.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/57e3d367d20277447bdad4fe/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/BREAKTHROUGHS%252520Chanel%252520Eyeshadow%252520in%252520Tisse%2525CC%252581%252520Gabrielle.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Devon Abelma", "Fiona Gibb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/dot-eyeliner-instagram-trend", "title": "The Dot Eyeliner Trend: Here's Exactly How to Pull It Off", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "We chatted with professional makeup artists about dot eyeliner, how to create precise circles, and what other makeup to pair the look with.", "id": "587ff50c4d2ce4e43c8d0471", "keywords": "emma roberts,eye liner,flirt cosmetics,revlon,chanel,Pinterest", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "587ff50c4d2ce4e43c8d0471", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We chatted with professional makeup artists about dot eyeliner, how to create precise circles, and what other makeup to pair the look with.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Connect the dots.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "This Unexpected Eyeliner Trend Is About to Blow Up Instagram", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/dot-eyeliner-instagram-trend"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Connect the dots.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "This Unexpected Eyeliner Trend Is About to Blow Up Instagram"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
