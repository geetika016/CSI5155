Cook.\n\n\"Alright, I couldn't resist,\" she captioned the picture.\n\nStiles' rep confirmed in June that Stiles and Cook, an actor and camera assistant, will welcome a baby later this year. The couple met on the set of the 2015 movie Go with Me, and got engaged in Isla Grande, Columbia, on Christmas Eve in 2015.\n\n\"All around, it was a really wonderful trip,\" Stiles told People in August. \"We stayed on an island that was really beautiful and there was a lot of great snorkeling.\"\n\n\"I'm not getting a ton of marital advice,\" she added. \"We're really slow on the wedding planning so I haven't really been soliciting advice.\"\n\nAlright, I couldn't resist.
