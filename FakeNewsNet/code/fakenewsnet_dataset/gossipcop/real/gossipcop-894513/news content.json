Unfortunately, it sounds like we\u2019re going to have to wait a bit longer, because the Today host isn\u2019t putting any pressure on her kids Cody Gifford, 27, or Cassidy Gifford, 24, to procreate.\n\n\u201cOf course I want to have grandchildren,\u201d she told E!, but admitted she\u2019s willing to be patient. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to marry until they\u2019re ready to, until they find the right person for them and then have a child that they\u2019re ready for. All in God\u2019s timing, not mine.\u201d Luckily, Kathie has plenty of little ones to play with in the meantime. \u201cThe minute I married my late husband, Frank Gifford, I became an instant grandmother,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe was already a grandfather so I know what it\u2019s like to have those little ones around, and we have babies around.\u201d\n\nCody, Kathie Lee, and Cassidy Gifford.\n\nIt sounds like her son is already on track to creating a family of his own, but that means Kathie has to share him on holidays, including Thanksgiving this year. \u201cCody is going to be with his girlfriend where she lives and see her family this time,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey take turns. I\u2019ll see him at Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\u201d Luckily, she will have one of her kids home for the holidays. \u201c[My daughter] Cassidy is going to be home though!\u201d\n\nIt sounds like the two of them have a very laid-back celebration planned. \u201cWe just cook, I start cooking on Wednesday and we cook through Thursday and then we have our meal and everybody just sits around and talks, that\u2019s all we do,\u201d said Kathie. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite, favorite holidays because it\u2019s about gratitude and that\u2019s what this world needs more of. We don\u2019t need more stuff. We do not need any more stuff. We just need more gratitude and more kindness.\u201d See, it\u2019s wise words like that that would make Kathie a killer Grandma!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kathie-lee-cody-cassidy-giffords.jpg?w=1180&h=550&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Prince-william-is-close-to-kates-parents.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3163px%2C1792px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kathie-lee-gifford-frank-gifford.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2017-09-15-at-5-08-41-pm.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kathie-lee-gifford.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/wayne-brady-daughter.jpg?crop=485px%2C53px%2C2637px%2C1494px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kathie-lee-gifford.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mountain-mamas-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C13px%2C768px%2C435px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hgtv-stars-mountain-mamas.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C954px%2C541px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/william-frawley-i-love-lucy-cast-in-color.jpg?crop=399px%2C0px%2C824px%2C824px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/father-knows-best-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Shares-the-Secret-to-Her-Marriage-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/tyrabanks_13181298_1068779926512470_1505875086_n.jpg?crop=143px%2C0px%2C684px%2C683px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oliver-Kate-Hudson-recall-parents-having-child-1.jpg?crop=70px%2C0px%2C1852px%2C1852px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gwen-stefani-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C2400px%2C2400px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_editorial_390976d.jpg?crop=147px%2C213px%2C1820px%2C1820px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/prince-george-and-princess-charlotte-christmas-gifts.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C2968px%2C1682px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Says-Her-Familys-Christmas-Day-Tradition-Is-to-Serve-at-a-Homeless-Shelter-Promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-13-at-11-04-50-am.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/angela-lansbury-jessica-fletcher.jpg?crop=0px%2C336px%2C1144px%2C648px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kathie-lee-gifford.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/kathie-lee-gifford-grandchildren-147075/", "title": "Kathie Lee Gifford on Grandchildren: There's No Rush for Her Kids to Have Babies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "One of the most loving people in the world is Kathie Lee Gifford, and we can't wait to see her as a grandmother!
