Ben Affleck for Burger King\n\nIn 1989, Affleck plays an all-American bro who receives an accidental call from a woman hoping to order in Burger King (because that's a thing). Just as he's delivering her food, his uh, car phone, rings and he's got to get back for curfew and loses out on winning her over with a Whopper....\n\n2. Lindsay Lohan for Jell-O\n\nHere's a little-known fact: LiLo was a member of Cos and the Gang, a '90s rap group that rapped exclusively about purple jello. Their 1995 hit, \"Kids Go Ape,\" really holds up. Trust.\n\n3. Mila Kunis for Lisa Frank\n\nFact: Mila Kunis, like us, spent the '90s coveting all the Lisa Frank\u2014what more can she say?\n\n4. Leonardo DiCaprio for Bubble Yum\n\nLeo stars alongside a \"loud-thumpin', tune-pumpin' Boombox,\" which is a natural counterpart to a chunk of Bubble Yum, but rest assured, unlike a stereo it'll \"never blow out,\" and \"keeps it poppin'.\"\n\n5. Brad Pitt for Pringles\n\nBrad Pitt has always been as hot as he is at present. As cool? That's up for question thanks to this '80s beach scene gold.\n\n6. Kristen Stewart for Porsche\n\nStewart has a cool dad. What exactly does that entail in 1999? It means getting a vroomy-esque ride in his Porsche when you miss the bus.\n\n7. Britney Spears for Maull's Barbecue\n\nWhat makes that meat a culinary thrill? Maull's Barbeque sauce and a 1993 Britney Spears cameo.\n\n8. Tina Fey for Mutual Savings Bank\n\nIf Fey could perform anything before our eyes, we'd like it to be a spot-on parody of herself in this '90s bank commercial (down to her carpet-print vest, of course).\n\n9. Meg Ryan for Burger King\n\nWe're seen Ryan enthusiastic many times over, but nothing compares to her utter eagerness to share Burger King's \"Aren't You Hungry\" Whopper Game. Sorry Affleck, but she's got you beat.\n\nYou should also check out:\n\n6 Bizarre Things Celebrities Have Been Sued For\n\n20 Celebrities You Never Knew Were Friends\n\n7 Celebrities Who Have Openly Owned Up to Plastic Surgery", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408im_/http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/980x490/landscape-1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408im_/http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/marieclaire/20150424145132/images/blank.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408im_/http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/980x490/landscape-1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["More From"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a14196/old-celebrity-commercials-before-famous/", "title": "9 Times Celebrities' Younger Selves Starred in Hilariously Cheesy Commercials", "meta_data": {"title": "Old Celebrity Commercials - Famous Commercial Cameos", "description": "We couldn't have imagined these in our wildest dreams.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"app_id": 128598260542816}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Marie Claire", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a14196/old-celebrity-commercials-before-famous/", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408im_/http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/980x490/landscape-1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg", "url": "http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/980x490/landscape-1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg", "width": 980, "height": 490}, "title": "9 Times Celebrities' Younger Selves Starred in Hilariously Cheesy Commercials", "description": "We couldn't have imagined these in our wildest dreams.", "article": {"section": "Celebrity", "published_time": "2015-04-24 05:05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24 17:06:03", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MarieClaire", "title": "9 Times Celebrities' Younger Selves Starred in Hilariously Cheesy Commercials", "description": "If we've come to know one thing about celebrities, it's that each and every one has a past\u2014many of which includes a before-they-were-famous appearance so good we couldn't have imagined them in our wildest dreams.", "image": {"src": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150425105408im_/http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg"}}, "sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-24T13:05:00-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/768x384/landscape-1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://mac.h-cdn.co/assets/15/17/160x160/square-1429894608-mcx-commercials-index.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1429866300.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
