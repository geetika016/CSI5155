It recently world premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where Stan and Robbie were both in attendance.\n\n\u201cExactly\u2026 Can\u2019t wait to share #itonya with you\u2026 Dec 8th \u2013 NY & LA Jan 19th \u2013 everywhere else #90slife #90shair #90shorror,\u201d Stan wrote underneath the picture.\n\nWhile the meme referenced the events in 1994 that led to Harding\u2019s ex-husband hiring a hit-man to take Kerrigan\u2019s knee out before the Winter Olympics, many fans felt it was insensitive due to the prevalence of the #TakeAKnee movement in wake of President Donald Trump calling for the firing of basketball and football stars like Colin Kaepernick, who have chosen to protest the national anthem by taking a knee.\n\nAmid backlash, Stan has deleted the Instagram meme.\n\nAfter reading fan\u2019s comments, the actor issued several apologies in their comment sections on the social media platform.\n\n\u201cListen, guys, I\u2019m sorry. I recognize the bad timing of my last post and I truly apologize to anyone who may have been offended by it,\u201d he said in one, according to E! News. \u201cIt was in reference to an actual event that took place in 1994 which is now depicted in the movie I\u2019m currently promoting. Nothing more.\u201d\n\nRELATED: NFL: Trump\u2019s Criticism of Players Shows an \u2018Unfortunate Lack of Respect\u2019\n\nStan then wrote a longer apology on another fan\u2019s page, thanking them for educating him on the issue.\n\n\u201cWhen I put up the post, I had not carefully researched the kneeling reference. In the past few days I have done the homework I should have done before absentmindedly posting that\u2026To be clear on my values and where I stand\u2026I am an immigrant and now an American citizen,\u201d said the actor, who was born in Romania.\n\n\u201cMy parents and I came to this country when I was 12 years old. To be an American, growing up I have learned that you agree to support and uphold the constitution and all of its amendments, the freedom of speech and the right to peacefully protest in order to ensure equality and justice for all,\u201d he continued. \u201cLike many people, I am extremely anxious and worried about the things that I see on the news and in the world these days. I wish I could take it all back but here I am. I will strive to learn from this issue.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sebastian-stan.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1335px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sebastian-stan.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sebastian-stan.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1335px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ale Russian"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sebastian-stan-apologizes-for-sharing-i-tonya-meme-in-response-to-takeaknee-i-will-learn-from-this/", "title": "Sebastian Stan Apologizes for Controversial Take a Knee Meme", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "sebastian stan, sebastian stan apologizes, sebastian stan apology, sebastian stan meme, i tonya, sebastian stan i tonya", "news_keywords": "sebastian stan, sebastian stan apologizes, sebastian stan apology, sebastian stan meme, i tonya, sebastian stan i tonya", "description": "Sebastian Stan issued an apology after sharing a meme comparing Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding to the Take A Knee movement", "og": {"title": "http://people.com/movies/sebastian-stan-apologizes-for-sharing-i-tonya-meme-in-response-to-takeaknee-i-will-learn-from-this/", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sebastian-stan-apologizes-for-sharing-i-tonya-meme-in-response-to-takeaknee-i-will-learn-from-this/", "description": "Sebastian Stan issued an apology after sharing a meme comparing Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding to the Take A Knee movement", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sebastian-stan.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1335px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/sebastian-stan-apologizes-for-sharing-i-tonya-meme-in-response-to-takeaknee-i-will-learn-from-this/", "description": "Sebastian Stan issued an apology after sharing a meme comparing Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding to the Take A Knee movement", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sebastian-stan.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1335px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sebastian-stan-apologizes-for-sharing-i-tonya-meme-in-response-to-takeaknee-i-will-learn-from-this/", "title": "http://people.com/movies/sebastian-stan-apologizes-for-sharing-i-tonya-meme-in-response-to-takeaknee-i-will-learn-from-this/", "description": "Sebastian Stan issued an apology after sharing a meme comparing Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding to the Take A Knee movement", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sebastian-stan.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1335px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
