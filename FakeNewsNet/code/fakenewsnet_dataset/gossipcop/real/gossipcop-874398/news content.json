We must talk about it so that we remember how sad, horrific and tragic these moments are.\n\n\"To the people of Spain and Barcelona, I just want to add to the rest of the world outpouring of love and give our thoughts for you.\"\n\n3rd, 4th suspect arrested in connection to Barcelona van attack\n\nJames Corden addressed the terror attack in Barcelona with an emotional message on his show.

Dozens of people were injured, in addition to the deaths.\n\nThe harrowing act of terror was carried out hours after an explosion took place in a house roughly 60 miles away in an incident law enforcement officials say was related. Four people have been arrested in connection to the attacks.\n\nCorden ended his powerful message Thursday evening by paying tribute to the victims.\n\n\"We are thinking about the victims and their families on what must be unimaginable day of horror for them,\" he said.\n\nFellow CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert shared a similar message on his program Thursday evening.\n\n\"This is heartbreaking reminder that evil is real, and that the United States is not alone in fighting it,\" Colbert said after sending his thoughts to Barcelona.", "images":
