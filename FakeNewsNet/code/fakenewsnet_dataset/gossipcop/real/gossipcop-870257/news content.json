He told his story to Men's Health.\n\nFirst, he revealed why he decided to make a change: an old friend saw him for the first time in years, let out an audible gasp, and said something that Reza found both painful and motivating.\n\n\"Specifically, he asked me when I had given up on life,\" he recalled.\n\nOnce Ashley Borden came into the picture, the two figured out the flaws in his regimen, which included running since he ran marathons when he was younger.\n\n\"The problem with Reza is that he was actually overtraining in the beginning,\" she said. \"He was running so hard that he was burning muscle.\"\n\nShe refocused Reza into strength and conditioning-forward exercises and created meal plans that are featured in Rezafit. And Reza really took to the program, particularly the meal-prepping, which he hadn't done before but was something that ended up really helping him succeed.\n\n\"As soon as the food part kicked in, I knew that regardless of what was going on that I would [have something healthy] to eat to fuel me up,\" he said.\n\nAnd he's found happiness in all that hard work: \"You really change your life. It sounds a little corny and cheesy, but it's true.\"", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/363/371/191121_4072298_Kenya_Moore_Regifts_Eva_Marcille___s_Present.jpg?itok=NxsEr3b_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/kandi-burruss-todd-tucker-job.jpg?itok=jhifQcUC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/teresa-giudice-father-hospital-sick.jpg?itok=EBsFDhuK", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/gina-kirschenheiter-tamra-judge-ryan.jpg?itok=sLquCVLH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/05/the-feast-gotm-203-b.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/08/the-feast-reza-weight-loss.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-11/lizzie-rovsek-thanksgiving-family-sons.jpg?itok=tLysfC2i", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-rhop-01.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-rhobh-01.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-reza-farahan.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/21/155/191119_4070822_Teresa_Giudice_Reveals_Joe_Gorga_Was_Engaged.jpg?itok=AhrX2jos", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/tinsley-mortimer-scott-kluth-engaged.jpg?itok=CXp2GZlS", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/793/627/191120_4071641_Kenya_Moore_Clashes_with_Cynthia_Bailey.jpg?itok=3I0rVRYM", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/lala-kent-gizelle-bryant-bravocon_1.jpg?itok=KyqXcoy5", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/166/675/170622_3540097_Reza_Farahan_on_Adam_s_Reaction_to_His_Weigh.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/field_season_cast_photo/2018/12/shahs_s7_2560x1440_nologo.png?itok=sUjwqJoi", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-10/eva-marcille_1.jpg?itok=0nYM6__u", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-bd-med.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/aftershow-sc-01.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-11/reza-farahan-mj-javid-friendship.jpg?itok=DjG-w6v5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-10/rhoc-aftershow-playlist-promote.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-reza-farahan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tamara Palmer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/shahs-of-sunsets-reza-farahan-shares-fitness-weight-loss-secrets", "title": "Reza Farahan Shares the Fitness Secrets Behind His 40-Pound Weight Loss", "meta_data": {"title": "Shahs of Sunset's Reza Farahan Talks Weight Loss, Exercise | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "Shahs of Sunset\u00a0agent\u00a0Reza Farahan\u00a0has shed 40 pounds since December thanks to a strict\u00a0diet and fitness regimen\u00a0that includes eating lo", "title": "Reza Farahan Shares the Fitness Secrets Behind His 40-Pound Weight Loss", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/shahs-of-sunsets-reza-farahan-shares-fitness-weight-loss-secrets", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-reza-farahan.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/shahs-of-sunsets-reza-farahan-shares-fitness-weight-loss-secrets", "title": "Reza Farahan Shares the Fitness Secrets Behind His 40-Pound Weight Loss", "description": "Shahs of Sunset\u00a0agent\u00a0Reza Farahan\u00a0has shed 40 pounds since December thanks to a strict\u00a0diet and fitness regimen\u00a0that includes eating lo", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-reza-farahan.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-11T13:02:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-11T16:28:27-04:00"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "vertical_name": "The Daily Dish"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523466120.0, "source": "http://www.bravotv.com", "summary": ""}
