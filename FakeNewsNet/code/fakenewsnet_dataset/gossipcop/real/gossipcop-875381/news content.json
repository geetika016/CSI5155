{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "text": "2010 single by Taylor Swift\n\n\"Mine\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, it was released as the lead single from Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010) by Big Machine Records. Following an unauthorized internet leak, the song was released on August 4, 2010, two weeks earlier than the intended release date. Swift was inspired to write \"Mine\" after reflecting on one of her unnamed crushes and explained that the song is about her tendency to run from love. The song contains elements of power pop and its lyrics speak of the ups and downs of a young love.\n\nCritical reception for \"Mine\" was mostly positive. Swift was praised for her ability to show a mature perspective on love, although some critics called the song \"formulaic\" for resonating her earlier works, notably \"Love Story\". The song was commercially successful; it became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada and Japan. The single was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United States, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 to debut multiple tracks in the top five during a calendar year after Mariah Carey did so in 1995.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Roman White. The video chronicles the romantic relationship between Swift and her love interest played by British actor Toby Hemingway which ends with a marriage. The music video was met with great praise from contemporary critics who deemed it as \"rather sweet,\" and \"heartwarming.\" The song was performed live at numerous venues to promote Speak Now. The music video received the Video of the Year Award at the 2011 CMT Music Awards.\n\nBackground and release [ edit ]\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Swift revealed that \"Mine\" was inspired by an unnamed crush in mind, saying \"I was reflecting back on a boy I liked at a certain time.\"[2] She also told MTV that the song is about what it would be like if she actually let her guard down.[3] During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about \"her tendency to run from love\" after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups.[4] She continued, \"I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out.\"[4][5]\n\n\"Mine\" was one of the fourteen tracks in Speak Now that was written solely by Swift. She also co-produced the song with Nathan Chapman, who co-produced all of Swift's studio albums. It was originally planned to be released on August 16, 2010, however, after the leak of an unauthorized low-quality mp3 file of the song, Big Machine Records decided to ship the song to country radio and iTunes twelve days earlier than planned on August 4, 2010.[6][7][8] Swift commented that \"a leak is so out of my comfort zone, but it ended up good in the end. It made me so emotional that I started crying.\"[3][9]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n\"Mine\" (2010) A sample of \"Mine\" by Taylor Swift. The song is a country-pop song, which drew comparisons to Swift's previous works. Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\n\"Mine\" is a country-pop song with a length of three minutes and 52 seconds.[10] KILT-FM described \"Mine\" as \"an uptempo song that's unmistakably Taylor\" with \"a big chorus and [is] very singable.\"[11] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 explained that the song \"is a mishmash of ideas bolted together by a terrific power-pop chorus that will stick in your brain after the second or third listen.\"[12] The song is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from G 3 to D 5 .[13] It follows the chord progression of C 2 \u2013G 5 \u2013D 5 \u2013C 2 \u2013D 5 .[13] Alan Macpherson of The Guardian noted that the song \"reprises the joyous rush of Swift's breakthrough hit, \"Love Story\", but depicts love as an adult process rather than a teenage dream.\"[14]\n\nDave Heaton of PopMatters described the song as a \"song of rebirth\" with a \"fairly complex\" narrative.[15] He summarized the content of the lyrics, writing \"[i]t starts in the past, at the start of a relationship, and then lets us know it's a flashback. They\u2019re sitting on the couch reminiscing. It then jumps back to the beginning and steps us through the couple\u2019s years together, but all the while shifting perspective, jumping between their separate memories.\"[15] James Dinh of MTV noted that the song \"features an uplifting country/pop melody and a big chorus\" and it talks about \"the wonders of being in a happy relationship after surviving a rocky past.\"[1] Priya Elan of The Guardian believed that \"Mine\" depicts \"a stop-start relationship between a normal guy and girl\".[16] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly interpreted the song's message to be about \"young love blossoming \u2014 in this specific case, young college love.\"[17]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe song received mostly positive reviews by music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's lyrical craftsmanship, calling the song's couplets \"You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter\" as a \"brilliant throwaway detail.\"[18] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave the song three-and-a-half stars out of five, lauding its catchy yet melodious hook. However, he pointed out that the song reflects her earlier works in the first two albums and he wished that Swift would \"try something a little more out of the ordinary.\"[19] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five, commenting that although the song was \"formulaic,\" the formula was executed convincingly.[20] Chrissie Dickinson of the Chicago Tribune noted that \"Mine\" is an epitome of Swift's classic song-craft, calling it \"simple but honest expressions of emotion.\"[21] Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said that although the track is reminiscent of Swift's previous hits, he added, \"the song's origins are grounded more in failed relationships than storybook ones.\"[22]\n\nBlake Boldt of Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-down, criticizing Swift's failure to deliver an expected \"big payoff\" through the song. He contended that this failure proves that \"Swift's songwriting skills are still raw, still needing that one last polish in order to shine.\"[12]\n\nCredits and personnel [ edit ]\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.[23]\n\nTaylor Swift \u2013 vocals, songwriter, producer, acoustic guitar\n\nNathan Chapman \u2013 producer, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, banjo, digital piano, piano, synthesizer\n\nBrian Sutton \u2013 acoustic guitar\n\nJohn Gardner \u2013 drums\n\nNick Buda \u2013 drums\n\nShannon Forrest \u2013 drums\n\nGrant Mickelson \u2013 electric guitar\n\nMike Meadows \u2013 electric guitar\n\nPaul Sidoti \u2013 electric guitar\n\nRob Hajacos \u2013 fiddle\n\nTim Lauer \u2013 hammond B3\n\nAl Wilson \u2013 percussion\n\nEric Darken \u2013 percussion\n\nTim Lauer \u2013 piano\n\nSmith Curry \u2013 steel guitar\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nChart performance [ edit ]\n\nTwo days after its official release, it was estimated that \"Mine\" would sell approximately 350,000 digital downloads with a possible debut in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100.[31] On the week ending August 21, 2010, the song debuted at number one on the Hot Digital Songs due to 297,000 digital downloads, which led to its appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 at number three. This consequently made Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 to have multiple tracks debut in the top five during a calendar year (the first being Mariah Carey).[32] With 297,000 downloads, \"Mine\" became the eighth-biggest debut sales week ever for a digital song, and the fourth-best of 2010.[33] The song also debuted at number 26 on the Hot Country Songs on the week ending August 21, 2010, where it peaked at number two, having been blocked by Darius Rucker's \"Come Back Song\" at number one on the week ending November 13, 2010.[34] \"Mine\" also reached number one on the Adult Contemporary,[35] number seven on the Adult Pop Songs[36] and number 12 on the Pop Songs.[37] At the end of 2010, \"Mine\" was ranked at number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100 song of the year.[38] On August 21, 2014, the song was certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[39] As of November 2017, \"Mine\" has sold 2.3 million copies in the United States.[40]\n\n\"Mine\" achieved moderate success outside the United States.

Christ Church served as the venue for the wedding scene.[57] The video features Swift getting married to a groom, played by British actor Toby Hemingway, who was cast by Swift after watching Feast of Love. She was impressed with Hemingway and thought \"it would be perfect to put him in the video.\"[58] The video premiered on August 27, 2010, on CMT,[59] in a live half-hour special event which included a behind-the-scenes look of the video.[60] Swift returned to Kennebunkport, Maine to share the premiere with local residents, which attracted approximately 800 people, including former President George H. W. Bush, who brought his grandchildren to see Swift.[61]\n\nSynopsis [ edit ]\n\nThe video begins with Swift entering the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite where she is sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did when she was younger as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop.[62] Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nThe video was met with great praise from critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt the video was \"rather sweet\" and \"heartwarming\" in a sense that the song \"seems to have a happy ending.\"[63] Leah Collins of the Dose.ca lamented the video for its typical fairytale element even though the plot ended with a blissful marriage. She concluded her review by writing, \"Swift happens to include dirty diapers and recreating scenes from The Notebook.\"[64] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as \"a coming-of-age story\" where Swift is depicted to endure \"many adult life cycle events and major milestones.\"[52] In a different perspective, James Montgomery of MTV compared the music video with Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream,\" writing that although both videos are \"essentially about the same thing: the fantasies of young, thoroughly modern women,\" the fantasies are \"about as different as the women presenting them.\"[65] A reviewer from The Improper Bostonian also compared the music video with Perry's \"Teenage Dream\" and noticed that the two music videos presented two contrasting end points, writing \"for Swift, it\u2019s a marriage, a home and babies. For Perry, its independence and the ability to define your own life.\"[66] To date, the video has over 269 million views on YouTube.\n\nLive performances [ edit ]\n\nOn June 11, 2010, Swift performed the song for the first time at a small, intimate concert that aired as a part of CMA Music Festival: Country\u2019s Night to Rock on ABC on September 1, 2010.[67] She also performed \"Mine\" and \"You Belong With Me\" at the 2010 NFL Opening Kickoff event.[68] On October 5, 2010, Swift performed the song live on the Italian X Factor.[69] On October 9, 2010, she performed an acoustic version of \"Mine\" during Grand Ole Opry's 85th birthday celebration.[70] She later performed the song as well as an acoustic cover of Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\" in the BBC Radio 2 studio on October 21, 2010.[71]\n\nSwift sang \"Mine\" on several other occasions.

Kennedy International Airport where she sang \"Mine\" and several songs from Speak Now.[75]\n\nOn October 27, 2010, she visited Scholastic Corporation headquarters to talk about the importance of reading and writing and perform the song to a 200 grade-schoolers and middle-schoolers at the publisher's downstairs auditorium.[76] She later performed the song on Live With Regis and Kelly.[77] On November 2, 2010, Swift made an appearance on Dancing with the Stars where she performed \"Mine\" and \"White Horse\" for the show's 200th episode.[78][79] Swift was invited to perform in BBC Radio 1's first Teen Awards in London, where she sang \"Mine\", \"Love Story\" and \"Speak Now.\"[80] On November 19, 2010, she performed the song on the Japanese program Music Station.[81] \"Mine\" is the second song on the set for the Speak Now World Tour.[82]\n\n\"Mine\" was performed as the surprise song for the concerts in Indianapolis and Saitama during The Red Tour; and on December 8, 2015, Swift dedicated an acoustic performance of the song to 17-year old Rachel Erlandsen, who had died in a car crash before she was able to attend Swift's Australian leg of her 1989 World Tour in Brisbane.[83] It was most recently performed on her Reputation Stadium Tour in June 2018 as the surprise song for her show in Louisville.[84]\n\nTrack listing [ edit ]\n\nDigital download[6]\n\n\"Mine\" \u2013 3:49\n\nUK digital download[85]\n\n\"Mine\" \u2013 3:49 \"Mine\" (Music Video) \u2013 3:55\n\nPop Mix digital download[86][87]\n\n\"Mine\" (Pop Mix Version) \u2013 3:50\n\nGerman and UK CD single[88][89]\n\n\"Mine\" \u2013 3:49 \"Mine\" (US version) \u2013 3:51\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nSince May 2013 RIAA certifications for digital singles include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads.[115]\n\nRelease history [ edit ]\n\nList of radio and release dates with formats and record labels Country Date Format Label United States August 4, 2010[6] Digital download Big Machine August 24, 2010[116] Mainstream radio August 27, 2010[59] Music video Europe August 31, 2010[117] Digital download UK August 31, 2010[47] Digital download October 18, 2010[89] CD single Germany October 22, 2010[88]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagger-14-plain.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/19px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/56/Taylor_Swift_-_Mine.png/220px-Taylor_Swift_-_Mine.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/Taylor_Swift_-_Mine.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/Taylor_Swift_-_Mine.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "title": "Mine (Taylor Swift song)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.5", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/Taylor_Swift_-_Mine.png"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
