Photos: Lifetime/Getty Images/Alamy\n\nA beautiful young woman walks into an indie bookstore and meets the eyes of the handsome store manager. He\u2019s not hot, but cute, with unassuming mannerisms and a subtly winning smile. The pair banter about books flirtatiously, and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s an instant attraction, a *spark* if you will. The woman reaches up to grab a book off the top shelf, and the man scans her up and down. \u201cIf this was a movie, I\u2019d grab you and we\u2019d go at it right in the stacks,\u201d he says in a voiceover, invoking visions of spontaneous passion that should be familiar to anyone who\u2019s spent time watching romance films. But it isn\u2019t a movie. And it\u2019s not quite a romance, either \u2015 at least not one to be desired. It\u2019s the pilot episode of \u201cYou,\u201d the latest of Lifetime\u2019s forays into scripted television. \u201cYou,\u201d based on the novel of the same name, follows Joe Goldberg (Badgley), the charming bookstore manager, and his increasingly terrifying obsession with Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), a grad student and writer onto whom Joe projects all of his fantasies and expectations. In the midst of the Me Too movement, it might sound dicey, unnecessary and even counterproductive to put a charming white dude stalker front and center on television. And yet \u201cYou\u201d manages to be sharp and self-aware, skewering the very tropes you might expect to weigh it down. Much of this responsibility falls on the writing and on Badgley, who as Joe is left to narrate much of the first five episodes with his inner monologue.

At the end of the series\u2019 run, it was revealed (in a messy retconned twist) that Dan had been the titular Gossip Girl all along. At first glance, beyond their stated bookishness, heartthrob Dan and predator Joe don\u2019t seem all that similar. But then you start talking to Badgley and the similarities become clearer. As Badgley pointed out to me over the phone, \u201cIf any real person actually did the things that Gossip Girl did, is that person, no matter who they are, a sociopath? Aren\u2019t they manipulative? Aren\u2019t they abusive?\u201d And these sorts of observations are what make chatting with Badgley so much fun. He\u2019s a seasoned pro at doing press \u2015 he came of age in the public eye, after all \u2015 which means that he could come off as rehearsed, so media-trained as to be boring. But instead Badgley is contemplative, not only answering questions but also asking them. We talked about everything from romantic comedy conventions to the format of this interview. And really, what\u2019s more Dan Humphrey than that? So, I\u2019ve seen the first five episodes of \u201cYou,\u201d and they are any dating woman\u2019s greatest nightmare realized. Yes. Definitely. You play Joe, the very charming stalker at the center of this show. I\u2019m curious what initially drew you to the role? I was drawn to the project through the conversations I had with [\u201cYou\u201d co-creators] Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble. After I read the book, I could really admire the effect that Caroline [Kepnes\u2019] writing has on the reader. But [Joe is] not the sort of person that you want to live with day in, day out. I think I was actually quite cautious [going into the project], and what that has led me to do is learn to trust the other people in the process \u2015 the writers, the actors, the crew \u2015 so I\u2019m less attached to this person, this character. That\u2019s what I like about it now. Initially, I couldn\u2019t see all those things and couldn\u2019t tell exactly why I was compelled by it.\n\nLifetime/AE Elizabeth Lail and Penn Badgley in the pilot episode of \"You.\"\n\nI will say that the writing definitely takes the project beyond what its log line might suggest. Exactly. Right now, we\u2019re doing a lot of press, and this show hasn\u2019t been seen by anybody. So all we\u2019ve got is the log line. And how much can you go beyond the log line before spoiling a lot of what the show is about? I have experienced the show to be infinitely deeper than its teaser, but that\u2019s the medium and you have to work with that in the beginning. I find myself having to say things that are vague. I can\u2019t really speak to all the things that he\u2019s done, so what is it that Joe is? Well, he does things. What was it like to dig into this complex and obviously disturbing character while we\u2019re in the midst of having national conversations about sexual misconduct and abuse and harassment? I am grateful to the moment and that [the show] is coming out now. I think it would be bad if this show were to come out and it wasn\u2019t scrutinized and held to the standard that it will be held to now. It\u2019s interesting. [\u201cYou\u201d] is a show that is ultimately about a man. I mean it is about an obsession and it is about a subject, and it very much depends on this female character, this woman [Beck], but it is a show about a man. And... we\u2019re a part of it and we\u2019re trying to understand what that means now. I think what this show needs is for people to see it \u2015 that\u2019s the thing that closes the loop. Right now it\u2019s an open-ended question. I\u2019m sure you have heard these comparisons, but is Joe the logical conclusion of Dan Humphrey, whom you played on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d? Like\u2026 is Joe Dan Humphrey with a touch more sociopath? Well, the question is, if any real person actually did the things that Gossip Girl did, is that person, no matter who they are, a sociopath? Aren\u2019t they manipulative? Aren\u2019t they abusive? And then, if we follow that logic, how often is it that an [online] troll says something that, if it was enacted, would actually be murder? People speak so casually about wanting to kill other people online. So, in a way, Joe \u2015 I am not trying to defend anyone\u2019s behavior, least of all Joe\u2019s \u2015 but I think what I am troubled by and interested in, which this show is dealing with, is [the question of whether Joe\u2019s behavior] is an inappropriate following of logic that is set up by our culture. And, in certain ways, it is. Of course, this does not mean that his behavior is right, but it also means that a lot of our cultural norms are wrong.\n\nI was going to ask you about that. \u201cYou\u201d is a show that explores the way that we very casually put so much personal information out into the world, and how that information can be used or manipulated against us. Do you see the show as sort of a cautionary tale about social media? People might take that from it. The social media dimension is not one that I am as compelled by, personally. But I know that everybody sees this, [and] they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, it made me rethink that.\u201d I am thinking more [about the show\u2019s exploration of] gender dynamics, the cultural definition of love and relationships. What is appropriate and what is not. What is intimate, and what is not. What is humane, and what is not. And, yes, the social media thing confuses us all, honestly. So [\u201cYou\u201d] does shine a light on how it can be abused \u2015 as though we weren\u2019t aware of the end to which social media is being abused. It\u2019s pretty evident. I am also curious \u2015 you grew up in the public eye because of \u201cGossip Girl.\u201d You and I are the same age, and I just think about if people had been paying attention to my every move in 2007/2008, that would have been really rough. Yeah, that was [pauses] \u2015 you\u2019re right. Did that experience impact the way you read the \u201cYou\u201d script at all? Probably. But in ways that I am not so conscious of. It affects everything about the way that I think. I actually became grateful to all that because I learned very early on how merciless and manipulative [public attention] can be. You know, even an interviewer trying to communicate something that you\u2019ve communicated responsibly, it might get lost in translation. And then the person who reads it is a third level of translation. In the way that reflects on social media, I think I had to develop the discipline to not use it as a way to think that I can know or understand any person. I do not value it as a window into anything real. For better or worse \u2015 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good thing, I\u2019m just saying I think it\u2019s the way that I see it. I just don\u2019t see [social media] as valuable, because I have been up close and personal with how... it\u2019s just untrue. It\u2019s literally not a reflection of reality. So why would I try to find out something about someone in this way when I know that if anybody tried to do the same to me, they would literally actually be getting further from understanding who I am?\n\nWould anyone else be considered unassuming on the side of the street standing there too long? It\u2019s pretty evident that no one but a young handsome white man could do that. Penn Badgley on his character, Joe Goldberg, in \"You\"\n\nSomething I was really struck by in the pilot is when Joe has broken into Beck\u2019s house, and she comes home early, so he ends up hiding in her shower. We hear Joe say through his inner monologue, \u201cI\u2019m not worried. I\u2019ve seen enough romantic comedies to know that guys like me are always getting in jams like this.\u201d Is \u201cYou\u201d intentionally playing with the more problematic tropes of rom-coms? That\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s doing. That\u2019s what we were talking about before, which is that [\u201cYou\u201d] is examining and scrutinizing the definitions [of love and relationships] we have and all of these cultural standards. Like, [the culture says], \u201cThis is what a relationship can look like, this is what love can look like. This is how you should be. This is what it\u2019s cool to do.\u201d And then Joe is like, \u201cAlright, I will do all those things.\u201d And then he\u2019s got blood on his hands and everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI just did what you did!\u201d Yeah, there was even a study that came out in 2016 that showed that romantic movies literally perpetuate stalking myths and make it harder to prosecute stalkers. Which is crazy. That\u2019s absolutely terrifying. And I mean, who is responsible for romantic comedies? It\u2019s actually a very small group of people.... So I think it\u2019s healthy that we examine these standards and be ready to cast them aside entirely, and be like, \u201cWait, that\u2019s not humane. That\u2019s not human. That\u2019s not what love is.\u201d\u2026 There\u2019s so much about our idea of love that can\u2019t be separated from American consumerism and materialism and white privilege, all of this stuff. And I think that Joe is a great example of that. Would anyone else be considered unassuming on the side of the street standing there too long? It\u2019s pretty evident that no one but a young handsome white man could do that. And there\u2019s a lot of ways in which we don\u2019t examine that. I am ready to have that conversation if anyone else wants to. But again, I think it\u2019s more interesting once everyone has seen the show, and then as the seasons continue. [Editor\u2019s note: \u201cYou\u201d has already been renewed for a second season.] I hope that \u201cYou\u201d prompts that conversation! Pop culture is such a great, accessible way to dive into things that people might not feel comfortable talking about otherwise. Right. Any interview that I am able to do \u2015 if we can\u2019t address these things in a real way, does that mean we should talk about them differently, or does that mean we should augment these spaces so we can have a real conversation regardless of this show? Put that in print. Consider it done! Do you have any hope for the future of the romantic leading male character? Is there a way for us to have that conversation we\u2019re discussing, about the negative tropes that have been perpetuated, and then do it differently? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Netflix\u2019s \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d... I haven\u2019t, but I have heard good things. Well, it\u2019s delightful. And it has started an interesting conversation about a different mold of that male romantic lead. We all know that tropes exist. But if we start to realize that tropes shape behavior of real human beings, I think we need to question, like, what the fuck are these tropes doing here in the first place? Do we need tropes because it\u2019s what makes advertisers comfortable? If that\u2019s the answer, fuck tropes. Get rid of the tropes if they\u2019re negatively affecting any single human being\u2019s behavior. [But] no one wants to hear that in an interview that I am in\u2026 You know, there\u2019s a lot of dots that we should always be connecting, and if we don\u2019t assume that we have the attention span for it or the patience for it, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.\n\nDo we need tropes because it\u2019s what makes advertisers comfortable? If that\u2019s the answer, fuck tropes.
