The truth behind the Taylor Swift and Katy Perry feud has been largely a mystery. We could guess it had something to do with backup dancers, as Swift previously told Rolling Stone her song \u201cBad Blood,\u201d rumored to be about Perry, was about a singer \u201cwho basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.\u201d Facts were scant, though. Even with Perry\u2019s \u201cSwish, Swish,\u201d a song rumored to be about Swift that debuted last week (more than a year after Swift\u2019s track), we didn\u2019t know the full story. Now it\u2019s coming at you like a dark horse. During an extended \u201cPrimetime Carpool Karaoke Special\u201d on Monday night, Perry opened up about everything to host James Corden.\n\nAccording to Perry, the feud started because some of her usual dancers wanted to perform with Swift. Perry said she had no problem with the dancers\u2019 choice, but to make sure their contracts included a provision allowing them to drop out of Swift\u2019s ensemble when Perry went back on tour in a year or so. Well, when the time came for Perry to prepare for her tour, the dancers went to Swift\u2019s management to discuss leaving \u2015 and got fired. \u201cShe started it, and it\u2019s time for her to finish it,\u201d Perry told Corden. The singer said she tried to speak to Swift about the issue but noted, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d The singer continued, \u201cIt was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me, and I\u2019m like, OK, cool, cool, cool, that\u2019s how you want to deal with it? Karma!\u201d Then Perry went off like a firework: But what I want to say is that I\u2019m ready for that BS to be done. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, and there\u2019s going to be a reaction, and trust me, Daddy, there\u2019s going to be a reaction. It\u2019s all about karma, right? ... I think, personally, that women together, not divided, and none of this petty bullshit, women together will heal the world.
