The Star Trek captain stand-off concluded Tuesday evening with a ceremonial unblocking followed by playful banter:\n\nHe who must not be named\u2019s bff is now unblocked. \u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) November 28, 2017\n\nReferring, of course, to Issacs\u2019 role as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nTo be unblocked by @WilliamShatner I had to marry off a ginger royal, fire an intercontinental missile at Japan and get Trump not to insult heroic Native American code-talkers in front of an offensive painting of their worst enemy (that he put there). #TwoOutOfThreesNotBad \u2014 Jason Isaacs (@jasonsfolly) November 28, 2017\n\nUndoubtedly. Here\u2019s what people miss with @WilliamShatner: the unbroken continuity and cross-pollination between the sublime, disruptive, iconic performances \u2013 as Kirk & Denny amongst others \u2013 and the provocative, take-no-prisoners tweeter. I\u2019m all in. #ItsArtJimButNotAsWeKnowIt https://t.co/4CSNQmkNao \u2014 Jason Isaacs (@jasonsfolly) November 29, 2017\n\nShatner never publicly said why he blocked the Star Trek: Discovery star in the first place, but we\u2019re pretty sure it had something to do with an interview that arguably mischaracterized Isaacs as saying he would never want Shatner to be a guest star on the new series.\n\n\u201cKirk doesn\u2019t come along for 10 years and when we meet him, he\u2019s 26, so it would be a weird timeline if [Issacs\u2019 character met Kirk],\u201d Isaacs reportedly said in a U.K. tabloid story headlined \u201cJason Isaacs hopes William Shatner won\u2019t appear in Star Trek: Discovery.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSomeone asked which cast members from the existing series would you like to guest star. I think people watch good drama shows and they completely suspend their disbelief, they feel like they\u2019re looking through the keyhole at another world, if you do it well enough. If you have stunt celebrity cameo casting, it completely pulls them out of it. They feel like they\u2019re watching a Saturday Night Live sketch. So I just hope people believe our stories, are engaged with them, and I\u2019m happy to meet Will Shatner in real life in a restaurant.\u201d", "images": ["https://ew.com/img/streaming/hulu.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kirk1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kirk1.jpg?crop=0px%2C11px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gettyimages-501323914.jpg?crop=562px%2C0px%2C1801px%2C1801px&resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kirk1.jpg?crop=0px%2C11px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "title": "William Shatner ends Star Trek feud, unblocks Jason Isaacs on Twitter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "William Shatner, Jason Isaacs, Star Trek, Star Trek feud, William Shatner Jason Isaacs feud", "news_keywords": "William Shatner, Jason Isaacs, Star Trek, Star Trek feud, William Shatner Jason Isaacs feud", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "og": {"title": "'Star Trek' peace: William Shatner forgives Jason Isaacs, unblocks him on Twitter", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kirk1.jpg?crop=0px%2C11px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kirk1.jpg?crop=0px%2C11px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "title": "'Star Trek' peace: William Shatner forgives Jason Isaacs, unblocks him on Twitter", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kirk1.jpg?crop=0px%2C11px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511845200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
