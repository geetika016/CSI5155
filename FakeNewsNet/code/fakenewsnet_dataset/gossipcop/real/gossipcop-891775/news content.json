Michelle Collins said he was talking trash about her when she was hosting the After Show 'cause he wanted to be the host and now I just think he's annoying and fame hungry. Reply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\ndefinitely. there's no hope within that franchise. even the ones like Wells that make you stop and think they may be different....they're NO different.

He didn\u2019t actually say anything bad about her, but called out the producers for bringing her on BIP for drama/entertainment when she had a boyfriend. I tweeted him \u201cdidn\u2019t Alexis have a boyfriend too? Wasn\u2019t she brought on for the same reason? Or is that cool because she\u2019s your BFF?\u201d I just side eyed that whole thing.

Reply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nIf I was an actor I'd never date a reality tv person, unless that wasn't their original claim to fame like a chef who ends up as a judge on a comp show or something. Reply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\nLol I wish she was gay/Bi tbh.\n\n\n\nI'm interested to see how this fans out. As long as she is happy, that's all I care about.\n\nReply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\nThe comments about her looks always make me feel bad for her. Her medical condition and meds make her look off.
