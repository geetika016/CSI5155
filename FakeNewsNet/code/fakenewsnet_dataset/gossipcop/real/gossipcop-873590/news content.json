Makeup experts criticized her method of swatching, or applying the cosmetics on her arm to show how they look on the skin.\n\n\u201cI want you guys to see this pimple here,\u201d she said in a Snapchat video from the makeup chair. \u201cYou\u2019re stressing me the f\u2014 out.\u201d\n\nKardashian continued, \u201cOkay guys, I get it, I didn\u2019t know how to f\u2014ing swatch powders before at the beginning \u2014 I\u2019m learning.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian Snapchat\n\nThe wife of Kanye West then asked her makeup artist for a quick tutorial, practicing his two finger method on his arm.\n\nUmm\u2026 Kim what is going on with those new swatches?? \ud83c\udf75 Looks like chalk \ud83d\ude12 pic.twitter.com/yCTZg2UhZu \u2014 Jeffree Star (@JeffreeStar) August 14, 2017\n\nKardashian also addressed fans who lashed out at Star for blasting her new makeup kit.\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Kim what is going on with those new swatches?? Looks like chalk,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m never a fan of finger swatches so I\u2019ll have to try the @kkwbeauty on my face for a final verdict but\u2026 doesn\u2019t look great so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see that my fans are totally hating on someone like Jeffree Star for being honest about my struggle swatches. But because of his remarks I\u2019m learning,\u201d Kardashian said on Snapchat, noting that fans were bringing up racist remarks Star has made in the past and later apologized for.\n\n\u201cI get that it\u2019s a serious deal if you say like racial things but I do believe in people changing and people that apologize, I will give them the benefit of the doubt,\u201d she said. \u201cI know better than anyone that I hate when people bring up my past or mistakes that I\u2019ve made in the past so like, let him life. I welcome honest comments about my products and because of it, I\u2019m swatching better now.\u201d\n\nStarr responded on Twitter, praising the Keeping Up with the Kardashians personality for learning from honest reactions.\n\n\u201cThe fact that someone like @KimKardashian can understand and take real feedback is what a REAL boss bitch does,\u201d he said. \u201cLove you.\u201d\n\nUmm\u2026 Kim what is going on with those new swatches?? \ud83c\udf75 Looks like chalk \ud83d\ude12 pic.twitter.com/yCTZg2UhZu \u2014 Jeffree Star (@JeffreeStar) August 14, 2017\n\nI'm never a fan of finger swatches so I'll have to try the @kkwbeauty on my face for a final verdict but\u2026 doesn't look great so far \ud83d\ude30 \u2014 Jeffree Star (@JeffreeStar) August 14, 2017\n\nThe fact that someone like @KimKardashian can understand and take real feedback is what a REAL boss bitch does.
