Island trio \u2014 starring stand-up comedians Esther Povitsky and Benji Aflalo.\n\nThe two play a pair of overlooked millennial misfits from different backgrounds \u2014 with a strictly platonic friendship \u2014 trying to find their place in the status-obsessed culture of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI saved you from a walk of shame,\u201d he says in PEOPLE\u2019s exclusive sneak peek, above.\n\n\u201cThe walk of shame is an anti-feminist construct,\u201d she responds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a feminist \u2014 you\u2019re just too lazy to walk,\u201d he retorts.\n\nThroughout the season, the dynamic duo\u2019s misadventures include shooting their own music video, standing in line for a Lip Kit Pop Up and even trying their hand at retirement life.\n\nThe special two-episode premiere of grown-ish airs Jan. 3 at 8 p.m. ET, and Alone Together premieres Jan. 10 at 8:30 p.m. ET, both on Freeform.", "images":
