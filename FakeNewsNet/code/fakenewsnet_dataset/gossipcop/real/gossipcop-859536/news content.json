He was 34.\n\nDias\u2019 body was reportedly found in his Brooklyn apartment on Saturday after friends became concerned when they hadn\u2019t heard from him.\n\nDays before, Dias had allegedly taken what a friend believed to be LSD or mushrooms and \u201cfreaked out\u201d before retreating to his room, according to TMZ, which first broke the news of his death. The friend then left the apartment and later tried to contact Dias, but received no response.\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene, Dias was reportedly unconscious and unresponsive. He was pronounced dead shortly after, but his official cause of death has yet to be revealed.\n\nA New Jersey native, Dias attended the Westminster Choir College of Rider University, where he majored in music education before embarking on a career in reality TV. He first appeared on Season 13 of \u201cRoad Rules\u201d in 2004, becoming one of the few openly gay contestants on the reality competition series. The next year, Dias participated in \u201cThe Challenge,\u201d but was quickly eliminated.\n\nWatch a clip of Dias\u2019 introduction on \u201cRoad Rules\u201d below.", "images":
