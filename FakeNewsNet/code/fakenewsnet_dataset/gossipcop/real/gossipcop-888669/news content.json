Principal photography is now underway on the picture, which is being shot in London. The movie is set in the late 1960s as Garland arrives in the British capital for a run of sell-out concerts.\n\nAs well as Zellweger in the lead role, the cast includes Jessie Buckley (\u201cWar and Peace\u201d), Finn Wittrock (\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) and Michael Gambon (\u201cHarry Potter\u201d).\n\nGarland\u2019s dates at the Talk of the Town nightclub came toward the end of the icon\u2019s long career and shortly before her death. The movie will recount her performances, with some of her best-known numbers, including \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d\n\nThe film also delves into Garland\u2019s behind-the-scenes battles with management, her relationships with musicians and fans, and the unfolding family drama that provided the backdrop to the London performances. She died in London in June 1969.\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d is a Path\u00e9, BBC Films and Ingenious Media presentation of a Calamity Films Production. Executive producers include Cameron McCracken for Path\u00e9, Rose Garnett for BBC Films and Andrea Scarso for Ingenious.\n\nBritish stage director and Tony nominee Rupert Goold is directing \u201cJudy\u201d from a script by Tom Edge (\u201cThe Crown\u201d). BAFTA winner David Livingstone (\u201cPride\u201d) produces for Calamity Films.\n\nPath\u00e9 is distributing \u201cJudy\u201d in the U.K., France and Switzerland and will handle sales throughout the rest of the world.\n\nPOPULAR VIDEO ON VARIETY", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/screen-shot-2019-12-01-at-1.23.47-pm.png?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/judy-first-image-hr-1-cropped.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/alanis-morissette.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/questlove.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/balleralert-copy.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/judy-first-image-hr-1-cropped.jpg?w=999&h=562&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/cats-movie-2019.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/lil-bub-death-ftr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Frenee-zellweger-judy-garland-2-1202729890%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=ca&env=desktop&post_id=1202729890&comment_count=24", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2017/assets/build/images/_inlined/variety-black.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frozen-2-and-missing-link.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/knives-out-ko_d25_09887_r_rgb.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/best-amazon-black-friday-deals-fire-stick.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/apple-introduces-apple-arcade-apple-tv-ipad-pro-iphone-xs-macbook-pro-03252019_big.jpg.large_.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/martin-scorsese-leonardo-dicaprio.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/shutterstock_8626647ax-e1493870904518.jpg?crop=0px%2C5px%2C1000px%2C563px&resize=700%2C393", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/cats-movie-2019.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/shutterstock_editorial_10406954k.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/rexfeatures_10015791bb.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/4.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frozen-2-and-missing-link.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/questlove.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/judy-first-image-hr-1-cropped.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stewart Clarke", "International Correspondent", "Stewart'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/renee-zellweger-judy-garland-2-1202729890/", "title": "First Look: Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in \u2018Judy\u2019 Biopic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "A striking first image from \"Judy\" shows Renee Zellweger playing show business legend Judy Garland.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "news_keywords": "Judy, Pathe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "First Look: Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in \u2018Judy\u2019 Biopic", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/renee-zellweger-judy-garland-2-1202729890/", "description": "A striking first image from \u201cJudy\u201d shows Renee Zellweger playing show business legend Judy Garland in a biopic from Path\u00e9, BBC Films and Ingenious Media.
