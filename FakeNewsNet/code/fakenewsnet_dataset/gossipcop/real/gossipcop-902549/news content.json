I didn\u2019t have fancy clothes \u2014 neither did my baby \u2014 I didn\u2019t have a manicure. I mean I barely had time to shower, how was I going to get a manicure?\u201d\n\nThe actress added that the \u201cwomen at this mom\u2019s group were encouraged to brag\u201d about every aspect of motherhood. \u201cHow fast their labor was, how precocious their babies were with pooping, rolling over, sitting up, smiling \u2026 everything was a competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese were not my people,\u201d she said before noting that she \u201cnever went to any such mom\u2019s group again.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

So It\u2019s not enough to be a mom, you have to be the best mom.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Mayim Bialik on How She Tackles Talking Puberty with Her Sons: \u2018We Don\u2019t Want Them to Have Shame About Their Bodies\u2019\n\nBialik then urged mothers to join her in trying to \u201cfind more meaningful things to connect about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you ask someone, did you breastfeed, it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that you\u2019re asking because you want to pass judgement on them, it should be because you sincerely want to know, how did you choose to feed your baby and what was that like?\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWe can only do this together \u2014 moms, are you with me?\u201d she asked.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mayim-bialik.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mayim-bialik-b.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mayim-bialik.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/mayim-bialik-competitive-moms-tears/", "title": "Mayim Bialik Reveals She \u2018Left in Tears\u2019 After First Group Meeting with \u2018Competitive Moms\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Mayim Bialik, Mayim Bialik motherhood, Mayim Bialik moms, Mayim Bialik competitive moms, Mayim Bialik why moms competitive, Mayim Bialik sons, mayim bialik mommy-shaming, mayim bialik mommy shamed, mommy shaming", "news_keywords": "Mayim Bialik, Mayim Bialik motherhood, Mayim Bialik moms, Mayim Bialik competitive moms, Mayim Bialik why moms competitive, Mayim Bialik sons, mayim bialik mommy-shaming, mayim bialik mommy shamed, mommy shaming", "description": "On Thursday, Mayim Bialik\u00a0spoke out about her experiences with \"competitive\" mothers", "og": {"title": "Mayim Bialik Reveals She \u2018Left in Tears\u2019 After First Group Meeting with \u2018Competitive Moms\u2019", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/mayim-bialik-competitive-moms-tears/", "description": "On Thursday, Mayim Bialik\u00a0spoke out about her experiences with \"competitive\" mothers", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mayim-bialik.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/mayim-bialik-competitive-moms-tears/", "description": "On Thursday, Mayim Bialik\u00a0spoke out about her experiences with \"competitive\" mothers", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mayim-bialik.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/mayim-bialik-competitive-moms-tears/", "title": "Mayim Bialik Reveals She \u2018Left in Tears\u2019 After First Group Meeting with \u2018Competitive Moms\u2019", "description": "On Thursday, Mayim Bialik\u00a0spoke out about her experiences with \"competitive\" mothers", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mayim-bialik.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
