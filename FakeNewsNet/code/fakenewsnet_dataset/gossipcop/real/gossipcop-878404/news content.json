The pair previously collaborated on a skit for a 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\n\"Such a taxing day when they're like 'eat some cookie dough' and you're like 'ok I'll make this sacrifice for my art,' Swift captioned a behind-the-scenes video from the commercial's shoot.\n\n\u202aSuch a taxing day when they're like 'eat some cookie dough' and you're like 'ok I'll make this sacrifice for my art' go.att.com/tsnbts1 A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Sep 7, 2017 at 8:03am PDT\n\nTaylor Swift NOW is a curated video catalog available to AT&T customers via the company's DirecTV Now streaming service.

Me Do.\"", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3831574857636/2019/upi/59e07fd652626ebc95dac6c605846625/v1.2/Taylor-Swift-wins-Best-International-Artist-at-ARIA-Awards.jpg",
