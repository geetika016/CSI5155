Great news for her, but if she doesn\u2019t win next month, it would stretch the show\u2019s dismal Globes record to 0-30.\n\nDespite being one of three shows where the main stars have all won Emmy Awards, the NBC comedy is the biggest TV loser at the Globes. \u201cWill & Grace\u201d amassed 27 nominations and zero wins when it was first on the air from 1998 to 2006. Last year, it added two more nominations, for Best TV Comedy/Musical Series and Best TV Comedy/Musical Actor for Eric McCormack, to bring its record to 0-29. To their credit, the stars have had a good sense of humor about it, often toasting on the Globes when their names weren\u2019t announced.\n\nSEE Golden Globes 2019: Full list of nominations\n\nMessing received six nominations during the comedy\u2019s original run (she also has two nominations for \u201cThe Starter Wife\u201d). She wasn\u2019t expected to earn a nomination this year, sitting in ninth place in our predictions. But Messing received glowing reviews last month for her powerful performance in \u201cWill & Grace\u201d\u2018s #MeToo episode, in which Grace (Messing) revealed to her father Martin (Robert Klein) that his late friend had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.\n\nWill this finally be \u201cWill & Grace\u201d\u2018s year? Messing\u2019s nomination was the only one for the series, and she\u2019s up against two people, Kristen Bell (\u201cThe Good Place\u201d) and Rachel Brosnahan (\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d), whose shows are nominated for the top prize, with the latter being the reigning champ. Her other rivals are returning nominee Alison Brie (\u201cGLOW\u201d) and another comedienne in a revival, Candice Bergen (\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d), who won in 1989 and 1992 for the original.\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby\u2019s free newsletter with latest predictions", "images": ["https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sam-Mendes.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/forumz-130.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-sluggers.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/netflix-revivals-logo.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=620&h=360&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-report-annette-bening-adam-driver.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Amazon-Prime-Video-logo.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/136.jpg?w=367&crop=28px%2C0px%2C268px%2C268px&resize=12%2C12&strip=info", "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bcd7b69490f0d43d90db322752c119f?s=12&r=pg&d=monsterid", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/avatars/11963/5a47c7a2b5c86-bpfull.png?w=0&crop=0px%2C0px%2C250px%2C250px&resize=12%2C12&strip=info", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Oscar-statuette-atmosphere-.png", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/forumz-136.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Oscar-statuette-trophy-41.jpg", "https://graph.facebook.com/10104319653860944/picture?width=150&height=150", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oscar-odds-susan.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-experts-4.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/crown.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/big-little-lies-apple-westworld.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/elisabeth-moss-her-smell.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lover.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Roma-Parasite.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Daniel-Montgomery-senior-editor.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-3fYA_jjXdhqZ-.gif", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/knives-out-cast.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jlo.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/forumz-pointz-8394.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.goldderby.com&path=%2Farticle%2F2018%2Fwill-and-grace-golden-globes-nomination-losing-streak-0-30-debra-messing%2F&ct=article&lob=goldderby&loc=ca&env=desktop&post_id=1202691071&comment_count=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/joker.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/brian-cox-succession.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/avatars/3469/jh_1446435398-bpfull.jpg?w=0&crop=0px%2C0px%2C250px%2C250px&resize=12%2C12&strip=info", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Oscar-predictions-podcast-podcasts-1.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-goldderby/assets/images/mail.png", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-goldderby/assets/images/loading.gif", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nicole-Kidman-Tracy-Letts.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fleabag-1.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Eng"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goldderby.com/article/2018/will-and-grace-golden-globes-nomination-losing-streak-0-30-debra-messing/", "title": "\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 could extend its Golden Globes losing streak to 0-30", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "msvalidate.01": "87B78205BB25666E656DA3EB49F3FD42", "description": "Debra Messing received a Golden Globe nomination for \"Will &amp; Grace,\" which is the Globes' biggest TV loser.", "news_keywords": "Debra Messing, FYC, Will & Grace", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "author": "Joyce Eng", "content_type": "Article", "title": "'Will & Grace' could extend its Golden Globes losing streak to 0-30", "published_at": "2018-12-06 10:45:14", "image": "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=300", "comment_count": 1, "tags": "Will & Grace", "topics": "TV", "body": "In one of the surprises of the morning, Debra Messing received a Golden Globe nomination in Best TV Comedy/Musical Actress for \"Will & Grace\" on Thursday.
