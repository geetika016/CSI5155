Last month, the family announced that 96-year-old Philip will be stepping away from public duties in the fall and begin moving toward retirement.\n\nHis hospitalization forced him to miss the opening of Parliament on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cPrince Philip is in good spirits and is disappointed to be missing the State Opening of Parliament and Royal Ascot,\u201d said Buckingham Palace in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cHer Majesty is being kept informed and will attend Royal Ascot as planned this afternoon.\u201d\n\nAs per tradition, the queen gave a speech to Parliament Wednesday morning announcing the government\u2019s legislative agenda. This year\u2019s speech had dramatically less fanfare surrounding it, with the queen arriving by car rather than horse-drawn carriage and wearing a suit and hat instead of ceremonial robes and a crown. This is the first time with \u201creduced ceremonial events\u201d since 1974, according to the BBC. Officials said the dressing down of the ceremony is due to time constraints placed by the special election and conflicts with Queen Elizabeth\u2019s schedule.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ddee03d210000ab9834e497.png?cache=6GO4Ce5o4k&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de1444b210000ab9834e87b.jpeg?cache=71GD8MaE3o&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de46723210000787e34ea6e.jpeg?cache=qI1hL8vNAf&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de52bea1f0000d51adf024d.jpeg?cache=yTCbx2Pqc9&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ddfdc152500004f19d2e899.jpeg?cache=j2uxPSlmWj&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/596f984215000028008b29a8.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de406042500005723d2ec6d.jpeg?cache=IE5vTdSE3o&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ddee2022500005827d2e714.jpeg?cache=16RQk3QGfY&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de2e6eb1f0000201edf005a.jpeg?cache=fabNu4vtAP&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ddc536a2100007f7e34e07f.png?cache=rXQmHLm6Xs&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de007c51f0000d51adefd9c.jpeg?cache=va2J4EVjiU&ops=434_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de453b92500005827d2ec89.jpeg?cache=55wbATWzQ3&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de025201f0000201edefdb4.jpeg?cache=kbRZgQJN4i&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de45e202100007f7e34ea69.jpeg?cache=jpkIJenIyB&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de5275e1f0000d51adf0241.jpeg?ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5866cb25150000230091691a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de4fb1f2500004f19d2ed57.jpeg?cache=WGJnz36od3&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594a6faf1500001f008ff702.jpeg?cache=nlMZZFiboa&ops=1778_1000"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594a6faf1500001f008ff702.jpeg?cache=nlMZZFiboa&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prince-phillip-hospitalized-london_n_594a6e45e4b0db570d37f558", "title": "Prince Philip Hospitalized In London With An Infection", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffingtonpost.ca", "locale": "en-CA", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "description": "He'll miss a number of public events.", "keywords": "Royals british royal family Charles, Prince of Wales Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh", "og": {"title": "Prince Philip Hospitalized In London With An Infection", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594a6faf1500001f008ff702.jpeg?cache=nlMZZFiboa&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594a6faf1500001f008ff702.jpeg?cache=nlMZZFiboa&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prince-phillip-hospitalized-london_n_594a6e45e4b0db570d37f558", "site_name": "HuffPost Canada", "locale": "en_CA", "description": "He'll miss a number of public events."}, "article": {"tag": "Royals british royal family Charles, Prince of Wales Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh", "section": "Style & Beauty", "published_time": "2017-06-21T15:02:33Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-21T15:02:33Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostLife", "title": "Prince Philip Hospitalized In London With An Infection", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594a6faf1500001f008ff702.jpeg?cache=nlMZZFiboa&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "He'll miss a number of public events."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=ca&entryID=ca_594a6e45e4b0db570d37f558", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1", "taboola.category": "style"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498057353.0, "source": "https://www.huffpost.com", "summary": ""}
