Brady shared a personal story about his favorite part of Thanksgiving as a boy: Heading to grandma\u2019s house for some delicious biscuits. It\u2019s a tradition he\u2019s continued with his own kids, as he and his wife Gisele Bundchen showed off Brady\u2019s baking abilities on Instagram and Facebook.\n\n\u201cMy biscuits don\u2019t taste nearly as good as hers but after being smothered in butter and syrup, it\u2019s tougher to know the difference,\u201d Brady wrote.\n\n\u201cSmothered in butter and syrup\u201d certainly doesn\u2019t sound like something you\u2019d find in The TB12 Method, but no one will criticize Brady from veering away from his diet on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nBrady shouldn\u2019t have a hard time burning off all of that deliciousness when the Patriots hit the practice field early Friday morning. He was limited in practice on Thursday after missing Wednesday\u2019s session with an Achilles injury, but is expected to suit up for Sunday\u2019s tilt against the Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium.", "images": ["https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/09/30h-BOS-white-horizontal.png?w=408", "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2018/02/4_boston_wbz.png?w=220", "https://i0.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/11/Snow-Totals.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2013/11/brady-turkey.jpg?w=625", "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/themes/cbs-local/images/global/blank_1x1.gif", "https://i0.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/map3.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/200.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/monday-night-snow.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/between.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2018/11/1024snowruler.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/12/HaileyKrizan.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/11/graphic4.jpg?resize=55%2C55&ssl=1", "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/themes/cbs-local/plugins/modules/theme-manager/images/cbs-local-logo-white.png", "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2017/10/boston.png"], "top_img": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2013/11/brady-turkey.jpg?w=625", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/11/24/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-thanksgiving-biscuits-patriots-nfl/", "title": "Tom Brady Enjoys Some Biscuits Smothered In Butter & Syrup On Thanksgiving", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "tom brady, gisele bundchen, new england patriots, thanksgiving, tb12 method", "keywords": "tom brady, gisele bundchen, new england patriots, thanksgiving, tb12 method", "fb": {"pages": 7446277009}, "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msvalidate.01": "FDD12CE797EAB78953FDE9ACF7F312A5", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "og": {"title": "Tom Brady Gives Thanks To Fans, Shares Favorite Thanksgiving Memory", "image": {"identifier": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2013/11/brady-turkey.jpg", "width": 420, "height": 237}, "description": "Even Patriots quarterback Tom Brady can enjoy a cheat day on Thanksgiving.", "type": "article", "url": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/11/24/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-thanksgiving-biscuits-patriots-nfl/", "site_name": "CBS Boston", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-24T13:45:48+00:00", "suggested-social-copy": "Even Patriots quarterback Tom Brady can enjoy a cheat day on Thanksgiving.", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "modified_time": "2017-11-24T16:12:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2013/11/brady-turkey.jpg?w=640", "title": "Tom Brady Enjoys Some Biscuits Smothered In Butter & Syrup On Thanksgiving", "description": "Even Patriots quarterback Tom Brady can enjoy a cheat day on Thanksgiving.", "site": "/wbz", "text": {"title": "Tom Brady Gives Thanks To Fans, Shares Favorite Thanksgiving Memory"}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://boston.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3859903/2019/07/cropped-boston-favicon-5121.png?w=270", "description": "Even Patriots quarterback Tom Brady can enjoy a cheat day on Thanksgiving."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511499600.0, "source": "https://boston.cbslocal.com", "summary": ""}
