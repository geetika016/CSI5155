Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn\u2019t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed from blue to yellow to green to gone, I will be healthy.\u201d\n\nBut her condition took a turn after the Met Gala, and she thanked fans for their support after her hospital stay.\n\n\u201cThank you for all the love & concern that\u2019s been pouring in since Tuesday,\u201d Dunham wrote on Instagram. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m much healthier than I was a year ago, complications arose from my most recent endometriosis surgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be proud of those Met Gala pics \u2014 not just because I felt beautiful, surrounded by art and magic, hugging my best friend tightly, but because they\u2019re evidence that women contain steely multitudes.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lena-dunham3.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e3aac279f1e323c410aaea42544865c1?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lena-dunham3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1683px%2C883.575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lena-dunham3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1683px%2C883.575px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/bodies/lena-dunham-cancels-lenny-tour-endometriosis-complications/", "title": "Lena Dunham Cancels Lenny Tour: 'I'm in the Greatest Amount of Physical Pain that I Have Ever Experienced'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Lena Dunham, Lena Dunham health, Lena Dunham endometriosis, Lena Dunham lenny, Lena Dunham lenny letter, Lena Dunham surgery, Lena Dunham hospitalized, Lena Dunham lenny tour, Lena Dunham lenny irl, Lena Dunham body", "news_keywords": "Lena Dunham, Lena Dunham health, Lena Dunham endometriosis, Lena Dunham lenny, Lena Dunham lenny letter, Lena Dunham surgery, Lena Dunham hospitalized, Lena Dunham lenny tour, Lena Dunham lenny irl, Lena Dunham body", "description": "Lena Dunham cancelled her planned Lenny tour across the country due to her endometriosis surgery complications", "og": {"title": "Lena Dunham Cancels Lenny Tour: 'I'm in the Greatest Amount of Physical Pain that I Have Ever Experienced'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/lena-dunham-cancels-lenny-tour-endometriosis-complications/", "description": "Lena Dunham cancelled her planned Lenny tour across the country due to her endometriosis surgery complications", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lena-dunham3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1683px%2C883.575px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/bodies/lena-dunham-cancels-lenny-tour-endometriosis-complications/", "description": "Lena Dunham cancelled her planned Lenny tour across the country due to her endometriosis surgery complications", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lena-dunham3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1683px%2C883.575px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/lena-dunham-cancels-lenny-tour-endometriosis-complications/", "title": "Lena Dunham Cancels Lenny Tour: 'I'm in the Greatest Amount of Physical Pain that I Have Ever Experienced'", "description": "Lena Dunham cancelled her planned Lenny tour across the country due to her endometriosis surgery complications", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lena-dunham3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1683px%2C883.575px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
