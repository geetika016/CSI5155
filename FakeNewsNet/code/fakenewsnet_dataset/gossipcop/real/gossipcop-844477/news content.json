Their lovebirds Elizabeth and Will Turner essentially bid farewell to audiences at the end of the third film, At World\u2019s End, when Will was remanded to spend the better part of eternity cursed to be captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman. A recent trailer finally offered a new glance at Bloom\u2019s character, however, thus raising the question of whether his wife would make a cameo as well.\n\nIndeed, she does reappear, although a glimpse may be all you\u2019ll really see of Knightley as Elizabeth Turner (nee Swann). Nevertheless, it\u2019s a smart match, if it\u2019s not too bold to say.\n\nIf you need even more Turner family news, the fifth movie will introduce audiences to Will and Elizabeth\u2019s son, Henry (Brenton Thwaites), who embarks on a search for answers about his father, accompanied by fierce academic Carina (Kaya Scodelario) and, of course, rum-soaked raisin Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales arrives in theaters May 26.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/pirates.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/pirates.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Snetiker"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/18/keira-knightley-returns-in-pirates-5-international-trailer/", "title": "Keira Knightley returns in Pirates 5' international trailer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Pirates 5, Pirates of the Caribbean, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Keira Knightley, Keira Knightley Pirates 5,", "news_keywords": "Pirates 5, Pirates of the Caribbean, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Keira Knightley, Keira Knightley Pirates 5,", "description": "Elizabeth Turner is back", "og": {"title": "Keira Knightley Returns in New 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5' Trailer", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/18/keira-knightley-returns-in-pirates-5-international-trailer/", "description": "She's back", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/pirates.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/18/keira-knightley-returns-in-pirates-5-international-trailer/", "description": "Elizabeth Turner is back", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/pirates.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/18/keira-knightley-returns-in-pirates-5-international-trailer/", "title": "Keira Knightley Returns in New 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5' Trailer", "description": "Elizabeth Turner is back", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/pirates.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492488000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
