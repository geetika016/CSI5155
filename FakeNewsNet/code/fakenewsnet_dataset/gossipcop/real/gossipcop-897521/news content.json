For the inauguration in January 2017, she wore a pale blue Ralph Lauren cashmere coat dress with matching suede pumps and gloves that called to mind Jackie Kennedy\u2019s chic style, and she\u2019s continued to rock high-fashion designs ever since. Though, much like former first lady Michelle Obama before her, Melania\u2019s outfits keep Us guessing.\n\nWhether she was hosting her first state dinner for French President Emmanuel and First Lady Brigitte Macron in a sparkling Chanel Haute Couture gown (which originally appeared on the brand\u2019s spring 2018 runway as a jumpsuit) or sporting a pastel Burberry coat to read to children at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, the First Lady\u2019s wardrobe creatively and tastefully embraces color, texture and design. Oh, and we will forever be amazed by her ability to have a rainbow-hued stiletto (Christian Louboutin is her fave) to match just about any outfit.\n\nHere at Stylish, we\u2019ve been keeping tabs on her most, well, stylish moments both at home and abroad. Keep scrolling to see her best looks!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1301298259-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mel.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3604px%2C1894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_474115357-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e6d09a61-4b1e-4e59-b067-acad18d82532-1-1.jpeg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mel.jpg?w=200", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mel.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3604px%2C1894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roxanne Adamiyatt", "Cristina Gibson", "Meg Storm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/melania-trumps-most-stylish-first-lady-moments-w498714/", "title": "Melania Trump\u2019s Most Stylish First Lady Moments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "First Lady Melania Trump made an appearance in a Delpozo midi dress on Sunday, August 20 \u2014 see more of her most stylish looks here", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Melania Trump's Latest Outfit Is a Stunner", "description": "See the fresh look the former model opted for and more of her most fashionable milestones as First Lady!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/melania-trumps-most-stylish-first-lady-moments-w498714/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-11-27T15:56:46+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Melania-Trump-FLOTUS-Style-FB.jpg?resize=1200,630", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Melania-Trump-FLOTUS-Style-FB.jpg?resize=1200,630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "stylish", "section": "Stylish", "published_time": "2019-11-27T15:55:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-11-27T15:56:46+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "See the fresh look the former model opted for and more of her most fashionable milestones as First Lady!", "title": "Melania Trump's Latest Outfit Is a Stunner", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Melania-Trump-FLOTUS-Style-T.jpg", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1574870156.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
