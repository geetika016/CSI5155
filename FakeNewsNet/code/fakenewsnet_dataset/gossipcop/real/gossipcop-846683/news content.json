He has written and worked on some of the most iconic songs of all time, from Whitney Houston classics to A Whole New World in Disney\u2019s Aladdin.\n\nHe also produced Titanic\u2019s song My Heart Will Go On and wrote Mariah Carey\u2019s Hero.\n\nKatie is truly a small town girl, originally from Elmira, New York. She has credited her work ethic to her upbringing.\n\nNot afraid to speak her piece, Katie made her way on her own and her unpretentious and affable nature really sticks out on a reality TV show where one of the \u201cwives\u201d has a 15+ bedroom mansion.\n\nMonsters and Critics met Katie back inside her salon The Painted Nail when it opened in 2009.\n\nHer swanky salon served up wine and took nail art to stratospheric heights. That scenario and the whole \u201coff the charts\u201d vibe caught the eye of mega-producer SallyAnn Salsano (Jersey Shore) who created a TV series Nail Files with Katie as the star.\n\nBut her path to being a successful business owner was hard, and Katie noted on the new E! series how she lived out of her car early on as she made her way in Los Angeles.\n\nThe road to doing nails and creating her own line of nail products was made possible through proper cosmetic nail school and following her imaginative take on this fun and lucrative beauty discipline.\n\nThe Painted Nail sits right outside the W Hotel and will be used in the series as a set while the Second Wives Club cast gets buffed and dishes on other cast members not present.\n\nAll through it, we see Katie act as a Swiss mediator and referee with a wicked sense of humor.\n\nIn past interviews, Katie has mentioned that she really loves fast food chain Taco Bell and we saw this as she took one of the affluent wives, Veronika (formerly married to plastic surgeon Dr. Michael Obeng), to the drive-through for tacos.\n\nEven though she loves \u201cthe Bell\u201d, Katie can go high-brow too with food and has a new place to visit in Los Angeles: Hi SocieTEA, which she describes as a \u201cmini tea bar serving gourmet loose leaf teas, artisan sandwiches and \u2018Hi Tea\u2019 with a twist.\u201d\n\nA total fashionista, Katie has described her look in previous interviews as a \u201cbit butch\u201d and has a knack for pairing inexpensive clothes with high-end accessories like shoes and handbags.\n\nHer complete off-script realness and sense of humor and her willingness to work hard daily to make everyone feel more beautiful makes her one of our favorite reality stars, period.\n\nSign up now for your TV newsletter!\n\nSecond Wives Club airs Thursdays at 9/8c on E!", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;u=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cubW9uc3RlcnNhbmRjcml0aWNzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNyUyRjA1JTJGa2F0aWUtbWFpbi11c2UtMTAyNHg1NzMuanBn;w=1024;h=573;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTAyNCA1NzMiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjU3MyIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/katie-main-use-1024x573-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/katie-main-use-1024x573-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April Neale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/who-is-katie-cazorla-from-second-wives-club-on-e/", "title": "Who is Katie Cazorla from Second Wives Club on E!?", "meta_data": {"og": {"article": {"author": {"image": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8bdfb2ee92b01b4df3c48790212d850b?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Who is Katie Cazorla from Second Wives Club on E!?", "description": "Meet Katie Cazorla from Second Wives Club on E!.
