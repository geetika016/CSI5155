In a sneak peek at Monday\u2019s episode first shared by E! News, several of the guys are stripping down for the dirtiest group date ever: mud wrestling!\n\nIn the clip, Lindsay, 32, is joined by her Bachelor besties Corinne Olympios, Alexis Waters, Raven Gates and Jasmine Goode. The ladies all don clear raincoats to protect themselves as the first two contenders, Brady and Bryce, take the pit. (Which, by the way, is nothing but a flimsy inflatable pool filled with mud.)\n\nImage zoom ABC/Matt Brown\n\n\u201cBrady vs. Bryce \u2014 it was a pretty back-and-forth competition,\u201d says Lindsay, later quipping about Brady\u2019s coiffed \u2018do, which, shockingly, remains intact throughout the tousle.\n\n\u201cBrady\u2019s hair is a force that can\u2019t be reckoned with,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of hair products he is using today, but he needs to patent it!\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: The Bachelor\u2018s Vanessa Grimaldi Reveals Her First Impression of Fianc\u00e9 Nick Viall\n\nUp next, Dean and Eric go head-to-head \u2014 or rather, chest-to-chest \u2014 and let\u2019s just say Eric sums up the evening rather well.\n\n\u201cNever, ever, ever, have I ever done anything this embarrassing in front of a bunch of people. But I think it\u2019s all about effort!\u201d\n\nHappy watching, everyone.\n\nThe Bachelorette airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/bachelorette.jpg?crop=0px%2C281px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/bachelorette.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/bachelorette.jpg?crop=0px%2C281px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-contestants-mud-wrestle-shirtless-rachel-lindsay-sneak-peek/", "title": "Down & Dirty!
