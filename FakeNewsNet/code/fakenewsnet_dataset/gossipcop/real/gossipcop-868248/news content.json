On Tuesday (Dec. 5), further details have emerged detailing the conditions of Bennington\u2019s death, via autopsy and toxicology results.\n\nThe findings, published through TMZ, show \"a trace amount\" of alcohol in the singer's system at the time of death. An earlier version of this story reported MDMA (ecstasy) was also detected, though TMZ now asserts that after Bennington's blood tested \"presumptive positive\" for the drug, two subsequent tests disproved this. A prescription bottle of Zolpidem (the generic version of the sleep aid Ambien) and a small amount of beer was also found in Bennington\u2019s bedroom.\n\nThe report coincides with June\u2019s suicide report. \u201cAutopsy findings are characteristic of suicidal hanging,\u201d deputy medical examiner Dr. Christopher Rogers\u2019 report reads. \u201cThere was a history of suicidal ideation [in Bennington].\u201c\n\nThe Linkin Park frontman had battled depression and alcoholism throughout his life and attended rehab in 2006. According to his longtime friend Ryan Shuck (who played guitar in Bennington\u2019s side project Dead by Sunrise) he had been six months sober at one point in 2017. While his friends said he was in good spirits and planning for the future through much of this year and last, he had also suffered alcoholic relapses over that time.\n\nOn Oct. 27, members of Linkin Park, Blink-182, No Doubt and numerous other stars held a tribute concert in Bennington\u2019s honor at Los Angeles\u2019 Hollywood Bowl. On Dec. 15, LP plans to release One More Light Live, featuring 2017 recordings from the band\u2019s final shows with its fallen singer.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.billboard.com/assets/1512060607/images/Billboard-white.svg?228e8e63d94b4e751230", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/selena-gomez-a7cei-bb27-2017-mkxsms-cover-dw83k-dole-snrj94-xv-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/879509920/?value=1.00\u00a4cy_code=USD&label=wh8cCLa922cQoIOxowM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1554285401541797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/selena-gomez-a7cei-bb27-2017-mkxsms-cover-dw83k-dole-snrj94-xv-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/02-chester-bennington-bw-portrait-2009-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/02-chester-bennington-bw-portrait-2009-a-billboard-1548.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/02-chester-bennington-bw-portrait-2009-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Payne"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171206033110/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8061667/chester-bennington-linkin-park-toxicology-autopsy-report", "title": "Chester Bennington Toxicology Report Surfaces Following Linkin Park Singer's Suicide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Linkin Park\u2019s Chester Bennington: Toxicology Report Released", "description": "The tragic, unexpected death of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington was ruled a suicide by hanging on July 20, when his body was discovered in his Los Angeles home.
