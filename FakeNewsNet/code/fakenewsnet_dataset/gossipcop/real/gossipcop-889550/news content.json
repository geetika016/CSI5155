The Vogue editor appeared on The Late Late Show on Wednesday, October 25, and revealed who she wouldn\u2019t invite back to the lavish fete.\n\nCelebrities\u2019 Political Affiliations\n\nDuring the \u201cSpill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts\u201d segment, host James Corden gave Wintour the choice to eat pickled pigs feet or name the celebrity she\u2019d never extend an invitation to again. Without hesitation, Wintour quipped: \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d\n\nWintour was a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election against Trump. In October of that year, Vogue officially endorsed Clinton, marking the first time the magazine had ever publicly endorsed a presidential candidate. \u201cObviously we felt it was a moment in history for women,\u201d Wintour told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cAt times like that you need to take a leadership position\u2026. To me, it was in support of women.\u201d\n\nStill, readers can expect to see First Lady Melania Trump within the pages of the fashion magazine. \u201cWe have a tradition of always covering whoever is the first lady at Vogue,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t imagine that this time would be any different.\u201d\n\nIn December of that year, Wintour publicly apologized after allegedly being overheard criticizing the Trump Foundation and his future presidency. \u201cTrump\u2019s foundation has done nothing,\u201d Wintour said, according to British tabloid The Mirror at the time. \u201cIts board is packed with relatives, and he\u2019s going to use his presidency to sell himself and his brand and profit personally for himself and his family.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_1301298259-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anna-wintour-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C513px%2C269px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/donald-trump-melania-trump.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_474115357-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/e6d09a61-4b1e-4e59-b067-acad18d82532-1-1.jpeg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anna-wintour-james-corden.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anna-wintour-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C513px%2C269px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anna-wintour-reveals-who-she-would-never-invite-back-to-the-met-gala/", "title": "Anna Wintour Reveals Who She Would Never Invite Back to the Met Gala", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Anna Wintour revealed the one person she wouldn\u2019t invite back to the Met Gala \u2013 find out who it is!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anna Wintour: I Would Never Invite Donald Trump Back to the Met Gala", "description": "Anna Wintour revealed the one person she wouldn\u2019t invite back to the Met Gala \u2013 find out who it is!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anna-wintour-reveals-who-she-would-never-invite-back-to-the-met-gala/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anna-wintour-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C513px%2C269px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anna-wintour-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C513px%2C269px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-10-26T13:29:33+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Anna Wintour revealed the one person she wouldn\u2019t invite back to the Met Gala \u2013 find out who it is!", "title": "Anna Wintour: I Would Never Invite Donald Trump Back to the Met Gala", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/anna-wintour-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C513px%2C269px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509024573.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
