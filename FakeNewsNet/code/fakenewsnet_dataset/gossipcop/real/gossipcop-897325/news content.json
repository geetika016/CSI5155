And turns out, she also slyly debuted her husband Kanye West\u2018s long-awaited Yeezy Season 6 collection.\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star, 37, revealed she wore a total of nine Yeezy outfits on Tuesday. \u201cMy schedule was so busy, I ended up in nine different Yeezy outfits in one day,\u201d Kardashian explained on her website and app.\n\n\u201cFor each look, I wanted to stick with neutral vibes,\u201d she added.\n\nLest you think Kim tired herself out styling all those looks, don\u2019t worry: She had an assist from CR Fashion Book editor Carine Roitfeld, long a friend of the family\u2019s. Kardashian thanked the editor on Twitter after tweeting out photos from her fashion parade, and added, \u201cAnd I love [my hometown of] Calabasas for being my runway!\u201d\n\nThank you Carine Roitfeld for styling Season 6 #Yeezy \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 4, 2017\n\nAnd I love Calabasas for being my runway #Yeezy \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 4, 2017\n\nImage zoom Splash\n\nImage zoom Splash News\n\nLooking for more style content?
