It really scares me because everyone is so good,\u201d Pieterse, 21, said a video package during rehearsals.\n\nSince joining season 25 of the reality series, Pieterse shared in September that she was down 15 lbs. \u2014 and leading up to Monday\u2019s performance, she revealed to viewers that she had lost even more weight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re halfway through the competition and I\u2019ve lost 37 lbs. It really is magical,\u201d said Pieterse, who gained nearly 70 pounds over two years due to a hormone condition called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling like me again,\u201d Pieterse previously told viewers. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy road, but being able to focus on getting myself healthy again, and the fact that I\u2019m seeing results, getting better is all I can ask for.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE\u2019s special issue 25 Seasons of \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 is on stands now.\n\nImage zoom\n\nAfter performing alongside Savchenko, Pieterse, who admittedly \u201cthoroughly enjoyed this week,\u201d received rave reviews from the judges.\n\n\u201cI love the way your body interprets these dances. You\u2019ve got so many beautiful angles,\u201d said Carrie Ann Inaba. \u201cMesmerized \u2014 well done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a well-crafted routine. I thought you had great chemistry together. There was a warmth going on between you,\u201d added head judge Len Goodman.\n\nPieterse was awarded a 24/30 for her number and said that being a contestant on the show was \u201csomething that I never dreamt of and I\u2019m doing it and I love it and I\u2019m so thankful for this opportunity.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nDespite the positive feedback from Inaba, Goodman and Bruno Tonioli, Pieterse found herself in jeopardy with fellow contestant Frankie Muniz, and was ultimately sent home.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible. I knew that it was going to be amazing, but it totally blew my expectations away. I have had such an incredible time and I love everybody here, so obviously this is a very sad moment for me, but I\u2019m juts so thankful,\u201d Pieterse said after receiving a standing ovation from audiences. \u201cI\u2019ve had an amazing experience and I\u2019m so happy that I got to share my story.\u201d\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/dwts1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/dwts-season-25-10.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sasha-pieterse-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C699.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sasha-pieterse-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C699.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/dwts-sasha-pieterse-eliminated-lost-37-lbs/", "title": "DWTS: Sasha Pieterse Eliminated, Actress Reveals She Lost 37 Lbs.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Sasha Pieterse, dancing with the stars, dwts sashsa, gleb savchenko, dwts disney night", "news_keywords": "Sasha Pieterse, dancing with the stars, dwts sashsa, gleb savchenko, dwts disney night", "description": "Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC", "og": {"title": "Pretty Little Liars' Sasha Pieterse Reveals She's Lost 37 Lbs.
