Gaga showed off her powerful pipes on both songs, infusing emotion into every note.\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lady-gaga-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/pushdown_327x216/public/media/halsey-taylor-swift-amas-roaming-2019-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/pushdown_327x216/public/media/selena-gomez-ama-rc-2019-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1574801122/images/Billboard-white.svg?093e088e7cba3e123a30", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/pushdown_327x216/public/media/Lizzo-ama-tiny-purse-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/bb27-Paul-McCartney-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/pushdown_327x216/public/media/taylor-swift-91-2019-amas-award-billboard-1548.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lady-gaga-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Atkinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096710/lady-gaga-grammys-2018-performance-video", "title": "Watch Lady Gaga Perform 'Joanne' & 'Million Reasons' at 2018 Grammy Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Grammys 2018 Performances: Watch Lady Gaga Perform 'Joanne' & 'Million Reasons'", "description": "Lady Gaga has performed on some pretty massive stages over the past year -- from the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show in February to headlining Coachella in April and kicking off her Joanne World Tour in August -- so it's only fitting that she cap her 2017-18 with the 60th annual Grammy Awards.", "og": {"title": "Watch Lady Gaga Perform 'Joanne' & 'Million Reasons' at 2018 Grammy Awards", "description": "Lady Gaga has performed on some pretty massive stages over the past year -- from the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show in February to headlining Coachella in April and kicking off her Joanne World Tour in August -- so it's only fitting that she cap her 2017-18 with the 60th annual Grammy Awards.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lady-gaga-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096710/lady-gaga-grammys-2018-performance-video", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096710/lady-gaga-grammys-2018-performance-video", "title": "Watch Lady Gaga Perform 'Joanne' & 'Million Reasons' at 2018 Grammy Awards", "description": "Lady Gaga has performed on some pretty massive stages over the past year -- from the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show in February to headlining Coachella in April and kicking off her Joanne World Tour in August -- so it's only fitting that she cap her 2017-18 with the 60th annual Grammy Awards.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lady-gaga-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}, "sailthru.title": "Watch Lady Gaga Perform 'Joanne' & 'Million Reasons' at 2018 Grammy Awards", "sailthru.description": "Lady Gaga has performed on some pretty massive stages over the past year -- from the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show in February to headlining Coachella in April and kicking off her Joanne World Tour in August -- so it's only fitting that she cap her 2017-18 with the 60th annual Grammy Awards.", "sailthru.author": "Katie Atkinson", "sailthru.vertical": "Grammys", "sailthru.tags": "Lady Gaga,News,Grammys", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-28 19:49:52"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517186992.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
