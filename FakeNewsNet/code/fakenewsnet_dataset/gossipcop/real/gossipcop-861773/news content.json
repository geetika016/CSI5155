Both parents documented the fun-filled day on social media, starting with Kardashian sharing an image of his daughter\u2019s must-have souvenir: Mickey Mouse ears hat with the date embroidered.\n\nThe trio were all smiles as they met and posed for family photos with Mickey and Minnie Mouse, but Dream got a little restless while on the \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d ride. All it took was a Lion King-like lift and some kisses from dad to get the little girl giggling again.\n\nImage zoom Source: Blac Chyna Snapchat\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\nChyna wore pink mouse ears while Dream donned a polka dot pink top and Minnie Mouse hat.\n\n\u201cThank You @disneyland for the best first Father\u2019s Day trip with my baby,\u201d Kardashian captioned an image of his daughter donning the headwear on Instagram.\n\nThe ex-fianc\u00e9s, who first split in March 2016, experienced their fair share of ups and downs throughout their yearlong romance, right from the outset of their relationship last January.\n\nKardashian proposed to Chyna in April 2016, and a month later, they announced they were expecting their first child. The two welcomed their daughter, Dream Ren\u00e9e, in November.\n\nFROM PEN: Jenna Bush Hager: \u2018My Daughter Calls Me \u201cM\u2019aam\u201d (It\u2019s a Southern Thing!)\u2019\n\nAfter a year of ups and downs, including screaming matches, therapy sessions and even a paternity test, which were documented on their E! reality show Rob & Chyna, and a fight that nearly ended their engagement right before Christmas, their romance came to an end earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThey split a while ago. The wedding plans are off,\u201d a source close to Kardashian told PEOPLE. \u201cThey are both trying to be mature about it. It was less dramatic this time.\u201d\n\nAlthough the couple attempted to make their relationship work, an insider told PEOPLE that Chyna became frustrated with Kardashian over time.\n\n\u201cChyna is super fed up with Rob and thinks he is way too emotional and depressed. She thinks he has terrible issues,\u201d said the insider, who knows both Chyna and Kardashian. \u201cHe is always battling his own insecurities and is unstable. It\u2019s a major turn-off to her, and she thinks it\u2019s incredibly unhealthy for the baby and their family.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/116ab788de5f8b786cd3e7aa9ed6e0c3?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-4-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C145px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C145px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/rob-kardashian-reunites-with-blac-chyna-for-fathers-day-with-dream-at-disneyland/", "title": "Rob Kardashian Reunites with Blac Chyna for Father's Day with Dream at Disneyland", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "rob kardashian, rob kardashian blac chyna, blac chyna, rob kardashian fathers day, rob kardashian dream, rob kardashian spends fathers day disneyland", "news_keywords": "rob kardashian, rob kardashian blac chyna, blac chyna, rob kardashian fathers day, rob kardashian dream, rob kardashian spends fathers day disneyland", "description": "The trio were all smiles as they met and posed for family photos with Mickey and Minnie Mouse", "og": {"title": "Rob Kardashian Reunites with Blac Chyna for Father's Day with Dream at Disneyland", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/rob-kardashian-reunites-with-blac-chyna-for-fathers-day-with-dream-at-disneyland/", "description": "The trio were all smiles as they met and posed for family photos with Mickey and Minnie Mouse", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C145px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/rob-kardashian-reunites-with-blac-chyna-for-fathers-day-with-dream-at-disneyland/", "description": "The trio were all smiles as they met and posed for family photos with Mickey and Minnie Mouse", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C145px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/rob-kardashian-reunites-with-blac-chyna-for-fathers-day-with-dream-at-disneyland/", "title": "Rob Kardashian Reunites with Blac Chyna for Father's Day with Dream at Disneyland", "description": "The trio were all smiles as they met and posed for family photos with Mickey and Minnie Mouse", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chyna-kardashian-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C145px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
