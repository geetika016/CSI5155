We see George O'Malley in his blue scrubs calling out to his old friend. Lexie Grey is behind the admin desk as Meredith says goodbye to a nurse. Her mother, Dr. Ellis Grey, watches her leave, as Doc the dog follows her down the hallway to\u2026Derek, who says simply, \"Hey\" before Mark Sloane also appears beside him. Ahhhhh, McDreamy and McSteamy together again. I'm not crying\u2014you're crying.\n\nIt was good to see them all again, but it also drives home how many important people Meredith has lost over the years. It's incredible that she's still a functional human. Showrunner Krista Vernoff talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the impetus for the episode's little twist. \"I loved the idea because after 15 seasons, it's exciting to be airing on a holiday we've never done an episode about\u2014and because it's the holiday of the community that is being attacked in our country right now by our government and misrepresented,\" she said. \"The holiday is delightful. I had just seen Coco with my daughter\u2014whose name is Coco\u2014and the idea that our loved ones who died can come visit us on this one day of the year was moving. I suggested Meredith's dead people come back and visit her in this episode.\"\n\nI was not alone in feeling an emotional gut punch, as evidenced by reactions on social media.\n\nShe also reveals that an earlier cut of the episode featured Denny Duquette and Kyle Chandler's bomb squad character, but they didn't feel authentic and were cut. But don't expect to keep seeing those beloved faces regularly. \"This was a Day of the Dead, one-time-only thing,\" Vernoff tells THR. \"The holiday is about the dead visiting the living and the living inviting the dead to come for a visit. So it felt like the perfect opportunity to see the people Meredith has lost.\"\n\nWhen the episode ends, Meredith hasn't called her father\u2026yet. It looks like she's heading in that direction, but as her voice-over notes, she's allowed to handle the situation however she wants. \"Every religion, every country, every culture, death means something different to all of us,\" she says. \"They all have different ideas about how to honor the dead. Different ideas of how to grieve. Different ways of moving on. Well, I may not be an expert but I do have some experience with losing people I love. And I say the right way to grieve is however the hell you want.\"", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5bdc559d04bbf50c79af64da/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/150505_3996.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5bdc55dfc1fcd07b9d83bd25/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/150505_0015.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5bdc559d04bbf50c79af64da/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/150505_3996.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5bdc559d04bbf50c79af64da/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/150505_3996.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/greys-anatomy-brought-back-familiar-faces", "title": "Grey's Anatomy Brought Back a Bunch of Familiar Faces for Last Night's Episode", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Derek, Mark, Lexie, George, Meredith's mom, and even Doc the dog made appearances in the latest 'Day of the Dead' episode of 'Grey's Anatomy.
