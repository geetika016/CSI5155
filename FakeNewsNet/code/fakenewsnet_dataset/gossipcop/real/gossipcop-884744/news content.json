People mean so well, but they have no idea the harm or frustration it can cause.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Dey Street Books\n\n\u201cOnce a month I look like I\u2019m in my second trimester because I\u2019m bloated,\u201d she says. \u201cIt leads to the questions and it leads to the rumors and anytime I go into a doctor\u2019s office I feel like I\u2019m a member of SEAL Team Six undercover because I don\u2019t want people to speculate.\u201d\n\nBy sharing her story in We\u2019re Going to Need More Wine, which is out Oct. 17, Union hopes that the way people approach her about the topic changes.\n\nFor more on Gabrielle Union\u2019s infertility struggles, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands now.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gabrielle-union-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-4.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C49px%2C1115px%2C586px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C49px%2C1115px%2C586px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne Tracy"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/gabrielle-union-infertility-struggles-exclusive-memoir/", "title": "Gabrielle Union's Heartbreaking Struggle with Infertility: 'I've Had Eight or Nine Miscarriages'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Gabrielle Union, Dwyane Wade, Zion Wade, Zaire Wade, Dahveon Morris, We're Going to Need More Wine, infertility, Gabrielle Union infertility struggles, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade", "news_keywords": "Gabrielle Union, Dwyane Wade, Zion Wade, Zaire Wade, Dahveon Morris, We're Going to Need More Wine, infertility, Gabrielle Union infertility struggles, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade", "description": "Gabrielle Union's book We're Going to Need More Wine (out Oct. 17) is excerpted exclusively in the current issue of PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "Gabrielle Union's Heartbreaking Struggle with Infertility: 'I've Had Eight or Nine Miscarriages'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/gabrielle-union-infertility-struggles-exclusive-memoir/", "description": "Gabrielle Union's book We're Going to Need More Wine\u00a0(out Oct. 17) is excerpted exclusively in the current issue of PEOPLE", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C49px%2C1115px%2C586px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/gabrielle-union-infertility-struggles-exclusive-memoir/", "description": "Gabrielle Union's book We're Going to Need More Wine (out Oct. 17) is excerpted exclusively in the current issue of PEOPLE", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C49px%2C1115px%2C586px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/gabrielle-union-infertility-struggles-exclusive-memoir/", "title": "Gabrielle Union's Heartbreaking Struggle with Infertility: 'I've Had Eight or Nine Miscarriages'", "description": "Gabrielle Union's book We're Going to Need More Wine (out Oct. 17) is excerpted exclusively in the current issue of PEOPLE", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gabrielle-union-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C49px%2C1115px%2C586px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
