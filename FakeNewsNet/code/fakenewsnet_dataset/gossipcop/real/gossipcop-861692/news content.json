The couple shocked everyone by getting married in a quickie Las Vegas ceremony Wednesday night following the Billboard Music Awards\u2014and it looks like they celebrated by taking another kind of plunge.\n\nAccording to Instagram stories reshared by the Daily Mail, the newly minted bride and groom celebrated with their friends by jumping into their hotel hot tub fully clothed at their after-party. Jonas still had on his gray tuxedo and the bride was wearing a white bridal jumpsuit look, all the way down to her Gucci shoes. The party reportedly lasted late into the night.\n\nThe wedding came as a complete surprise since the couple had been very vocal about their wedding plans. They previously announced they would get married this summer in France. But when in Vegas, am I right?\n\nWe imagine the night went off a little differently than the wedding they originally planned. Diplo, who performed at the wedding, served as the videographer documenting the night via Instagram stories. Turner walked down the aisle with a white bouquet featuring flashing blue lights to a live performance of \u201cSpeechless\u201d by Dan + Shay. The wedding was officiated by an Elvis impersonator, according to People, and the two exchanged Ring Pops instead of wedding bands before posing in Elvis glasses on the chapel\u2019s famed pink Cadillac for wedding photos.\n\nCourtesy of Instagram/@diplo\n\nCourtesy of Instagram/@diplo\n\nCourtesy of Instagram/@diplo\n\nCourtesy of Instagram/@diplo\n\nNick and Kevin Jonas stood by Joe\u2019s side for the big moment, and Turner\u2019s now official sister-in-law Priyanka Chopra reportedly served as the maid of honor. Conveniently held after the Billboard Music Awards, the ceremony was attended by other celebrities, including singer Khalid.\n\nSee more: How to Plan a Surprise Wedding Ceremony\n\nWhile we\u2019re SO excited for the happy couple, we do have to wonder, was the France wedding just a ruse?! Maisie Williams was supposed to be Turner\u2019s maid of honor and she wasn\u2019t even in attendance. And Joe wanted a flag rugby game at the wedding, so how could a wedding at the Chapel L\u2019Amour in A Little White Wedding Chapel suffice?", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/vR36Ry6kyiRwVCh6FP9P-lah0sA=/1024x576/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cb477aa10c0d167c464b5cb__169-bba484459d794c16a213e162119f0f2f.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg width=%27332%27 height=%27600%27 xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%3E%3Cg%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg width=%27333%27 height=%27592%27 xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%3E%3Cg%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://:0", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg width=%27324%27 height=%27601%27 xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%3E%3Cg%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg width=%27640%27 height=%271136%27 xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%3E%3Cg%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/vR36Ry6kyiRwVCh6FP9P-lah0sA=/1024x576/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cb477aa10c0d167c464b5cb__169-bba484459d794c16a213e162119f0f2f.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Milliner-Waddell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-vegas-wedding-after-party", "title": "The Perfect Way Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Celebrated Their Vegas Wedding", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Wednesday night Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner took another kind of plunge\u2014you know, besides getting married", "sailthru.tags": "brides,news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-vegas-wedding-after-party", "title": "The Perfect Way Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Celebrated Their Vegas Wedding", "description": "Wednesday night Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner took another kind of plunge\u2014you know, besides getting married", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/vR36Ry6kyiRwVCh6FP9P-lah0sA=/1024x576/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cb477aa10c0d167c464b5cb__169-bba484459d794c16a213e162119f0f2f.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "The Perfect Way Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner Celebrated Their Vegas Wedding", "description": "Wednesday night Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner took another kind of plunge\u2014you know, besides getting married", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/o09CHkUJdyT6zZgPsh8zxdCtYJA=/742x742/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cb477aa10c0d167c464b5cb__11-d3d1ed6ef6d84caf869d50c6dddcfbdf.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.23.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
