The new clip helps explain the next chapter in ABC\u2019s fantasy drama now that five of the main cast have left the show.\n\nPer the trailer, this fall\u2019s new episodes start off nearly identically to how Season 1 began back in 2011. Andrew J. West portrays an adult version of Henry, who himself finds out he has a daughter (Alison Fernandez) he didn\u2019t know about \u2014 just how Emma originally met her son. He is then thrust into the magical world of Storybrooke in a sort of a \u201creset\u201d on the first six seasons.\n\nThe black-and-white flashback-laden trailer also introduces new cast members Gabrielle Anwar, Adelaide Kane, and Dania Ramirez, as well as other heroes and villains.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d went through a major cast shakeup at the end of Season 6 when Jennifer Morison, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jared Gilmore, and Emilie de Ravin all exited. Series leads Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle, and Colin O\u2019Donoghue remain in the cast. ABC still renewed the show for a 22-episode order despite the changes.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d premieres in a new timeslot, Friday, Oct. 6 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nThe trailer for \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d Season 7 can be viewed above.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/zoe-kazan-betty-gabriel.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/1-8.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/cats-movie-2019.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/once-upon-a-time-7.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/lil-bub-death-ftr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/4-5.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2017/assets/build/images/_inlined/variety-black.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/3-6.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/frozen-2-and-missing-link.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fonce-upon-a-time-season-7-trailer-comic-con-abc-1202503637%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=ca&env=desktop&post_id=1202503637", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/knives-out-ko_d25_09887_r_rgb.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/best-amazon-black-friday-deals-fire-stick.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/apple-introduces-apple-arcade-apple-tv-ipad-pro-iphone-xs-macbook-pro-03252019_big.jpg.large_.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/martin-scorsese-leonardo-dicaprio.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/manifesto-limmortale.jpg?crop=0px%2C138px%2C4134px%2C2330px&resize=450%2C253", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/howard-stern-and-simon-cowell.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/howard-stern-and-simon-cowell.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/shutterstock_8626647ax-e1493870904518.jpg?crop=0px%2C5px%2C1000px%2C563px&resize=700%2C393", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/shutterstock_editorial_10406954k.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/miles-j-harvey-sonya-cassidy-carla-jimenez.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/4.jpg?resize=230%2C135"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/once-upon-a-time-7.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jd Knapp", "Staff Editor", "Jd'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/once-upon-a-time-season-7-trailer-comic-con-abc-1202503637/", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Drops Season 7 Trailer Explaining Next Chapter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Disney finally dropped a trailer for \"Once Upon a Time\" Season 7 at San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "news_keywords": "ABC, Comic-Con 2017, Disney, Once Upon A Time", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Drops Season 7 Trailer Explaining Next Chapter", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/once-upon-a-time-season-7-trailer-comic-con-abc-1202503637/", "description": "Disney finally dropped a trailer for \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d Season 7 at San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday.
