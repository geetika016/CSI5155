Her beloved mom Angie Douthit was diagnosed with brain cancer back in January, but things were looking better in March. Mack then revealed in May that her mother's cancer was spreading. \"You don\u2019t deserve this, none of it. So happy, so healthy, and so faithful to God. Stage four cancer in your lungs, in your brain, and now in your bones,\" the reality star wrote.\n\nNow, in an emotional post, Angie described what her \u201cnew journey\u201d with IV chemotherapy will bring. \u201cThis morning we leave at 7:30 to begin another new journey. IV chemo. I won\u2019t have my first treatment until Monday. I have education and nutrition classes this morning then the port will be surgically placed,\u201d the mother-of-four began. \"As I\u2019ve shared before, I dread chemo. However, God revealed to me that if I never had to go through IV chemo I would never fully understand cancer.\"\n\nAngie believes that by embracing her next chapter with cancer, she will be able to help others cope. \u201cI will now completely have full knowledge of what cancer patients are talking about. I\u2019m also going to get to meet some incredible people while I sit in that recliner for a few hours getting my drugs!\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe concluded the post with some amazingly inspirational words. \u201cSoak in every moment so you can use it to help others. Continue to smile and hug no matter how you might feel. Brighten someone's day, even if your day may seem bleak. Ask a friend if they need anything. Show them love, compassion, and forgiveness. Share the love of God everywhere you go, no matter where it is. Be nice!\u201d\n\nJust two months earlier, things were looking up for Angie. \"It\u2019s a good day, radiation and chemo are kicking this cancer's butt!\" Angie's doctor told her during a visit. According to Angie's new scans, her brain tumors are continuing to shrink and one of the tumors in her lungs went from 7 centimeters to 2 centimeters. She also had \"hundreds\" of smaller tumors in her lungs, and because of the treatment, they are all now either inactive or gone completely. \"I will continue on the chemo pill and will have more scans in April and May,\" she revealed.\n\nAngie's daughter Mackenzie was hit pretty hard when she found out about her mom's cancer diagnosis earlier this year. \"I\u2019m devastated, I\u2019m angry, I'm shook, I can\u2019t breathe. You are everything. Please pray,\" Mackenzie wrote in the caption of a collage of photos showing her close relationship with her mom on Instagram. On Jan. 2, she revealed that her mom's sickness was worse than they originally thought. \"All prayer warriors. Please pray for my mom. What we thought was bronchitis turned out to be three masses on her brain, one large one in her lung, and multiple blood clots. We are in shock and devastated. She has brain surgery tomorrow. I\u2019m sick. I\u2019m so sick and want to wake up,\" she wrote.\n\nThis is my mom threatening the doctors that she will call #TheGoodDoctor \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc95 pic.twitter.com/1U6vc3qdoQ \u2014 Mackenzie McKee (@DouthitKenzie) January 3, 2018\n\nThe news was extra shocking considering how fit and active Angie is. In November, they actually competed in a diabetes awareness run together, and her mom blew her out of the water! \"Thanks, Mom, for always setting a good example of health and fitness in my life,\" Mackenzie gushed at the time.\n\nMackenzie mentioned how well her mom treats her body in an interview with Us Weekly. \"She is the healthiest person I know,\" she said. \"Eats healthier than me. Always organic. Doesn\u2019t smoke, doesn\u2019t drink, she is a school teacher so [she] has no money. She runs marathons and works out two to three times a day. This does not run in our family,\" she revealed.\n\nLove Teen Mom?
