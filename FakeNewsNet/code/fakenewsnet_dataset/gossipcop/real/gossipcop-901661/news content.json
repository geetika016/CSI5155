Before his death in 2003, the alleged Bufalino crime family member claimed to have killed Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa (played by Pacino) on the orders of mob boss Russell Bufalino.\n\nDe Niro confirmed that the height difference was the reason for the towering platforms on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April, saying they made the shoes to give him more inches in height. \u201cThe guy [Sheeran] was actually much taller \u2014 about five, six inches taller than me \u2014 so [the shoes] were to show the relation to any of the other actors or characters that I\u2019m taller.\u201d\n\nAuthor Charles Brandt detailed Sheeran\u2019s deathbed confession about Hoffa in the 2004 non-fiction book I Heard You Paint Houses, from which screenwriter Steven Zaillian adapted The Irishman\u2018s story.\n\nImage zoom BACKGRID\n\nImage zoom Robert De Niro BACKGRID\n\nIn addition to his platform shoes, De Niro also wore a royal blue trench coat over a white collared shirt and dark slacks. He added a brown tie with diagonal stripes.\n\nPacino was costumed in a grey trench coat with coordinating pants. He also wore a white shirt with a red tie.\n\nThis is the fourth time De Niro and Pacino have worked together. They previously costarred in 2008\u2019s Righteous Kill, 1995\u2019s Heat and 1974\u2019s The Godfather Part II.\n\nIn addition to De Niro and Pacino, the movie will also star an out-of-retirement Joe Pesci (as Bufalino) as well as Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Ray Romano and Bobby Cannavale.\n\nThe Irishman hits theaters in 2018.\n\nSaveSave", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-1c.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-1c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/robert-de-niro-platform-shoes-al-pacino-the-irishman/", "title": "Robert De Niro Wears Platform Shoes To Tower Over Al Pacino", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro Al Pacino The Irishman, The Irishman movie, The Irishman Netflix, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro Al Pacino movies, Robert De Niro Al Pacino height, Robert De Niro Al Pacino, Robert De Niro Al Pacino height difference", "news_keywords": "Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro Al Pacino The Irishman, The Irishman movie, The Irishman Netflix, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro Al Pacino movies, Robert De Niro Al Pacino height, Robert De Niro Al Pacino, Robert De Niro Al Pacino height difference", "description": "Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were photographed on the New York City set of their 2019 Martin Scorsese flick \u2014 with\u00a0De Niro wearing lifts in his shoes", "og": {"title": "Robert De Niro Confirms His Massive Platform Shoes Were Made to Tower Over Al Pacino on Set of New Movie", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/robert-de-niro-platform-shoes-al-pacino-the-irishman/", "description": "Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were photographed on the New York City set of their 2019 Martin Scorsese flick \u2014 with\u00a0De Niro wearing lifts in his shoes", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-1c.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/robert-de-niro-platform-shoes-al-pacino-the-irishman/", "description": "Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were photographed on the New York City set of their 2019 Martin Scorsese flick \u2014 with\u00a0De Niro wearing lifts in his shoes", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-1c.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/robert-de-niro-platform-shoes-al-pacino-the-irishman/", "title": "Robert De Niro Wears Platform Shoes to Tower Over Al Pacino on Set of New Movie", "description": "Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were photographed on the New York City set of their 2019 Martin Scorsese flick \u2014 with\u00a0De Niro wearing lifts in his shoes", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/robert-de-niro-1c.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTcsFiDsK1A"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
