Unemployed should get assistance for a limited time and if they need it longer then they should be required to volunteer a certain amount of time each week. I had a friend in my early twenties that figured out if she had more children she would get more assistance. She also discovered that if she simply didn't get married to their father then she was considered a single mom and would get even more benefits. They simply started the father was unknown on the birth certificates and he lived with them, making almost 100k a year as a master plumber. She made just shy of 2k a month in food and WIC benefits as well as medicaid for all of the children. She also gets affordable housing. We last spoke a few years ago and she had popped out another two children because her first born had turned 18 and was no longer counted for benefits. She has been running this scam since she turned 18 and is now 39. She confessed that they have socked away enough money in her boyfriends savings account that they will buy a large place and retire when the last child moves out. Her eldest already has two kids and was following in moms footsteps. I regularly witness people paying for a huge cart of junk food and premium meats and seafood with ebt cards. Meanwhile, there are elderly people eating next to nothing sitting in shoddy housing and receiving a hundred a month for food. Children with parents working that can't afford enough food or good housing but are not able to get assistance because they make just over the allowed amount. The system needs to be fixed. First fix would be to limit the amount you can receive. More children doesn't equal more benefits. Work or volunteer hours required for the able bodied.", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AaB4lw2m4bRlxExj35rxgA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQw/http://media.zenfs.com/es-US/homerun/yahoo_view_839/8d8a12bc7a0b4b1e07ead9128791129f", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/E5rh2wg_iZimn2zUQSMcRA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQw/http://media.zenfs.com/es-US/homerun/yahoo_view_839/f7539331368c2c6a73cacc70fbbf98c6", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6e0wkXnSiaWztDSJ8gnuxw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQw/http://media.zenfs.com/es-US/homerun/yahoo_view_839/934586bdd6c30e497a1f7387c9b10dd0", "https://s.yimg.com/nn/lib/metro/DailyFantasy_BN_Baseball_300x250-min.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3Kfd4tEKSp2yOlpOZAIVqQ--~B/aD0yODg7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/es-US/homerun/yahoo_view_839/179d68abf42f9ce14227ab0e2e39cf40"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3Kfd4tEKSp2yOlpOZAIVqQ--~B/aD0yODg7dz01MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/es-US/homerun/yahoo_view_839/179d68abf42f9ce14227ab0e2e39cf40", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/hoda-kotb-gives-haley-joy-185300465.html", "title": "Hoda Kotb Gives Update on Haley Joy: \"She's Everything\"", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The \"Today\" cohost gushes over her infant daughter and shares one of Haley Joy's latest milestones!
