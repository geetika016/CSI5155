Sydney\u2019s husband, MLB player Anthony Bass, is out on the road playing, so the baby\u2019s uncles, Eric, and Jessie\u2019s brother, John, stop by to build a crib.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Jessie James Decker Talks Having More Kids With Football Hubby Eric Decker: 'I'm Game. Let's Do It'\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to have my family live in the same exact town as me, because I can always lean on them and depend on them if I need anything,\u201d Sydney shares.\n\nBut maybe she shouldn\u2019t lean on Eric and John for furniture construction. The duo struggles to put the crib together, with a new side falling off every time they add a piece.\n\nTune into Eric & Jessie on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET to see if the guys pull it together.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-11/black_friday_cyber_monday_sales.jpg?itok=EQMk58yz&h=119335f7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?itok=vaWrNCzh&h=6a65bc15", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-12/gettyimages-1189634215.jpg?itok=W97nvt_2&h=c673cd1c", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?itok=FSgrIsPZ"], "top_img": "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?itok=FSgrIsPZ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brice Sander"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/exclusive-eric-jessie-sneak-peek-eric-hilariously-fails-building-crib-88073", "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "http://www.etonline.com/exclusive-eric-jessie-sneak-peek-eric-hilariously-fails-building-crib-88073", "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib", "description": "With two kids of his own, you\u2019d think the NFL star would know how to do this by now!", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?itok=FSgrIsPZ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "With two kids of his own, you\u2019d think the NFL star would know how to do this by now!", "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Brice Sander\u200d", "url": "http://www.etonline.com/exclusive-eric-jessie-sneak-peek-eric-hilariously-fails-building-crib-88073", "image": "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?itok=FSgrIsPZ"}, "description": "With two kids of his own, you\u2019d think the NFL star would know how to do this by now!", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, Eric Decker, Jessie James Decker", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdaHf8UIWmk"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
