I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone,\u201d the actor said in a statement to People on Friday.\n\nDepp\u2019s joke, in reference to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth in 1865, was made during an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. \u201cI want to qualify, I am not an actor.
