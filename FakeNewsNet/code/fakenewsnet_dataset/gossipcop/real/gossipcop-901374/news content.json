She is Nala Ryan Dyrdek,\" he captioned a slideshow of pics featuring his newborn daughter. \"So thankful for the strength of my amazing wife and grateful for our growing family.\"\n\nBryiana also shared her excitement over baby No. 2, writing, \"My heart has never been more full than it is right now. @robdyrdek thank you for being the most amazing and supportive husband and the best daddy in the whole world! Kodah, your sissy is so lucky to have you as her big brother and I am so, so proud of you! Nala Ryan Dyrdek, welcome to our family.
