Instead, they told the judge that they had resolved all issues. A rep for Benoist did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe 29-year-old Supergirl actress filed for divorce nearly a year ago citing irreconcilable differences and did not seek either party to give spousal support, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE. The actress also requested to change her legal name back to Melissa Benoist.\n\nBenoist and Jenner, who don\u2019t have any children together, wed in spring 2015 after getting engaged in July 2013.\n\nImage zoom The Image Direct\n\nThe former couple met while playing love interests on Ryan Murphy\u2018s musical TV series Glee in 2012.\n\n\u201cI thought she was the bomb the second I saw her, so it was just super cool to be working together,\u201d Jenner told PEOPLE in 2014 about working with Benoist. \u201cThankfully, we\u2019ve had some scenes together. Because if we didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we would have had the time to get to know each other.\u201d\n\nOn their engagement, Jenner said: \u201cIt was fun, it was real low-key. It was private. I did sing, I sang \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 It was funny, it was a lot like us.\u201d\n\nJenner also guest-starred on two episodes of CW\u2019s Supergirl in 2016.\n\n\u201cI love working with him,\u201d Benoist told PEOPLE Now in March 2016. \u201cWe only have fun working together. He\u2019s my person to act with. He\u2019s my favorite scene partner, always.\u201d\n\nImage zoom JB Lacroix/WireImage; Michael Stewart/Getty\n\nA few months after Benoist filed for divorce, she was spotted getting cozy with her Supergirl costar Chris Wood.\n\nWood was previously tied to his Containment costar Hanna Mangan Lawrence, whom he reportedly split from in January.\n\nThe actor joined the CBS series in 2016 and stars opposite Benoist\u2019s Kara Danvers as her on-screen romance, Mon-El.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/melissa-benoist-blake-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/melissa-benoist.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/melissa-benoit-chris-wood.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/melissa-benoist-blake-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Dugan"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/melissa-benoist-blake-jenners-finalize-divorce/", "title": "Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner Finalize Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "melissa benoist, blake jenner, melissa and blake, melissa benoist supergirl, supergirl, melissa benoist divorce, tv, news", "news_keywords": "melissa benoist, blake jenner, melissa and blake, melissa benoist supergirl, supergirl, melissa benoist divorce, tv, news", "description": "The Supergirl star and her husband of two years are officially divorced", "og": {"title": "Supergirl's Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner Finalize Divorce", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/melissa-benoist-blake-jenners-finalize-divorce/", "description": "The Supergirl star and her husband of two years are officially divorced", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/melissa-benoist-blake-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/melissa-benoist-blake-jenners-finalize-divorce/", "description": "The Supergirl star and her husband of two years are officially divorced", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/melissa-benoist-blake-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/melissa-benoist-blake-jenners-finalize-divorce/", "title": "Supergirl's Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner Finalize Divorce", "description": "The Supergirl star and her husband of two years are officially divorced", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/melissa-benoist-blake-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
