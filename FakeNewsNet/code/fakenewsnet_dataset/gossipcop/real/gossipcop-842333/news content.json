The celebrity couple of two years welcomed their first child together two weeks ago, a source tells People. No word yet on whether it's a son or daughter for the famous duo.\n\nThe pair has kept the pregnancy pretty private, so it's no surprise that they aren't exactly going big with a birth announcement. Back in November, not long after Shayk appeared in the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, multiple sources told E! that the famous lovebirds were expecting a L.O. At the time, one insider said that the model was in her second trimester and was \"so excited\" about becoming a mom for the first time. Cooper's rep did not respond to requests for comment, and Shayk's rep had no comment, so they clearly didn't want to make a major to-do about their happy news.\n\nStill, in December, more insider gossip (apparently, the actor was \"protective\" of his bae throughout her pregnancy) followed, and in February, paparazzi caught Shayk rockin' her baby bump at Disneyland.\n\nNew parent? Sign up for our Parents Daily Babies newsletter\n\nNow that they've welcomed their bundle of joy \u2014 and reps for both Shayk and Cooper are staying mum on the birth \u2014 it's probably a safe bet that the new parents will be as private as ever. We'll just have to keep our eyes peeled for the odd public sighting of the new family of three, and chill 'til Cooper discusses dad life on The Tonight Show or Ellen at some point. In the meantime, congratulations to them!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2019/06/25153528/child-gardening-with-dog-ecfcae49.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2017/04/12223916/bradirina.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2019/06/24202248/father-and-children-on-bunk-beds-eb62abbe.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20125'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2019/06/28134754/two-moms-holding-children-f6b7869a.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2017/04/12223916/bradirina.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maressa Brown"], "canonical_link": "https://www.parents.com/baby/all-about-babies/bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk-welcome-their-first-child-together/", "title": "Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk Welcome Their First Child Together", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Oscar-nominated actor and his supermodel girlfriend are first-time parents!", "og": {"title": "Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk Welcome Their First Child Together", "type": "article", "site_name": "Parents", "url": "https://www.parents.com/baby/all-about-babies/bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk-welcome-their-first-child-together/", "description": "The Oscar-nominated actor and his supermodel girlfriend are first-time parents!", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2017/04/12223916/bradirina.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.parents.com/baby/all-about-babies/bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk-welcome-their-first-child-together/", "description": "The Oscar-nominated actor and his supermodel girlfriend are first-time parents!", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2017/04/12223916/bradirina.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://www.parents.com/baby/all-about-babies/bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk-welcome-their-first-child-together/", "title": "Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk Welcome Their First Child Together", "description": "The Oscar-nominated actor and his supermodel girlfriend are first-time parents!", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2017/04/12223916/bradirina.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 165082593548215, "pages": 10053803772}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.parents.com", "summary": ""}
