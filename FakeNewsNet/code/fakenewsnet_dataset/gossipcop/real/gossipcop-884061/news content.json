(Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage)\n\nDespite these allegations, many of Hef's ex-girlfriends, friends, and Playmates shared their condolences on social media.\n\n\"Outside of my family, you were the most important person in my life. You gave me my life... People tell me all the time that I was your favourite,\" Anderson wrote.\n\n\"Everything anyone loves about me is because you understood me. Accepted me and encouraged me to be myself,\" she added.\n\nKim Kardashian, who appeared on the cover of Playboy in 2007, also spoke out on Hefner's death, writing on Twitter:\n\nRIP to the legendary Hugh Hefner! I'm so honored to have been a part of the Playboy team! You will be greatly missed! Love you Hef!
