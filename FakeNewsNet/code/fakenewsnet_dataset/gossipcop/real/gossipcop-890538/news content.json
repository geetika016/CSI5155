But you know what? I\u2019m a champ, and I\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe crowd cheered loudly.\n\nWilliams proceeded to introduce the contest\u2019s winners, Lily and Pablo, who were dressed as daytime TV sets \u2014 and everything proceeded as normal, except for one joke about the incident as the episode wrapped up: \u201cIs that the end of the show? Was I passed out that long?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter the show aired, William\u2019s spokesman, Ronn Torossian, released a statement:\n\n\u201cMs. Williams fainted on-air this morning. She is dehydrated and is on her way home for a good day and nite of sleep. She has been examined by medical professionals and is well. She is ok and will continue as shows as planned. She will address this on-air tomorrow. She has never missed a day of work and is looking forward on November 13th to her 1500th show.\u201d\n\nWendy Williams came back after commercial break.
