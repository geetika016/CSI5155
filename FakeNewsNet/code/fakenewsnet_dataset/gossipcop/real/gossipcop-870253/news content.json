We\u2019ve seen them endure unspeakable hardships, such as weddings. Now, Entertainment Weekly has reunited the remaining Starks in a photo shoot \u2015 the Final Four, if you will \u2015 so you know a party is coming. The photos of Sansa (Sophie Turner), Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright), Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Arya (Maisie Williams) may reveal another, more subtle reunion going on, too. One tiny detail seems to further support information about the upcoming Season 7 from a rumored leaker:\n\nSee anything funny? Can\u2019t quite put your \u201clittle\u201d finger on it? Look again at Arya.\n\nThe young assassin is apparently brandishing a new blade at her hip, and it may be a blade we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nFollowing the release of the images, Redditors noticed that Arya seems to be carrying Littlefinger\u2019s Valyrian steel dagger. We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s the same knife because, as Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) says in the HBO show, there\u2019s only one like it in all the Seven Kingdoms. As BuzzFeed discovered, you can see better images of the dagger on ValyrianSteel.com. A listing explains it\u2019s \u201cofficially licensed from HBO\u2019s hit series \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis Catspaw Dagger from \"Game Of Thrones\" is sooo sick! Wish I could get one. #ValyrianSteelpic.twitter.com/zXlsMzImCu \u2014 Karthigesh P. (\uac00\ub514\ucf13) (@Violectric) February 24, 2014\n\nBran may recognize the dagger since a character known as the \u201ccatspaw assassin\u201d tried to use it to kill him in Season 1.\n\n(Reunions can be awkward, too.) Redditor JustACookiecat recalls the journey of the dagger, saying that the last we know of it, it was in Littlefinger\u2019s possession.\n\nIf all of this is true, and Arya does have Littlefinger\u2019s dagger, it seems to support the rumor (based on information from a suspected leaker) that Arya will kill Littlefinger in Season 7, possibly at Sansa\u2019s request. Considering other, similar suspected plot leaks shared on Reddit forums have since found more supporting evidence, things are not looking good for Littlefinger. After the Season 6 finale, Gillen told HuffPost his character likes \u201cheading into periods of uncertainty.\u201d Unfortunately for him, we\u2019re fairly certain about his fate in Season 7. Deuces, bruh.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5de54ec3210000a0a334ebdb.jpeg?cache=y0WHrFP2cY&ops=150_150",
