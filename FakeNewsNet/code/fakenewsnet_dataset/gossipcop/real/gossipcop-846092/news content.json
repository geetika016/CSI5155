I was on vacation just taking some time for myself and I have this thing where I\u2019ve been checking my status and taking pictures every week to see how far along I\u2019m going,\u201d Williams, 35, said. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell a lot of people to be quite honest and I\u2019d been saving it. On social media, you press the wrong button and\u2026 Thirty minutes later I missed four calls and I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s weird.\u2019 But it was a good moment. I was only going to wait five or six more days [to share].\u201d\n\nBut the slip-up doesn\u2019t have her stressing about future social media posts. \u201cEvery week I just take a picture and save it and I\u2019ve been so good about it and this was the one time I slipped, but it\u2019s okay,\u201d she said.\n\nOne week ago, the mother-to-be captioned a mirror selfie with her baby bump clearly visible underneath a custom yellow La Blanca Anniversary suit. \u201c20 weeks,\u201d she announced.\n\nLater that same day, Williams\u2019 rep confirmed to PEOPLE that she and her fianc\u00e9, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, will welcome their first child in the fall. \u201cI\u2019m happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall,\u201d the rep shared.\n\nImage zoom Source: Serena Williams/Snapchat\n\nAnd just days after the baby news, the sports star posted a moving love note to her unborn baby.\n\nAlso at the Ted Talks event, Williams opened up her career plans post-baby.\n\n\u201cRoger Federer is older than me and he\u2019s still winning everything,\u201d she said about getting back in championship caliber shape.\n\n\u201cMy baby\u2019s going to be in the stands, hopefully cheering for me,\u201d Williams gushed.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/serena-williams2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/serena-williams2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1125px%2C590.625px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/serena-williams2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1125px%2C590.625px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/serena-williams-accidentally-announced-pregnancy/", "title": "Serena Williams Says She Accidentally Announced Her Pregnancy: 'You Press the Wrong Button And...'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Vancouver Convention Centre, ted talk, serena williams, serena williams pregnant, Alexis Ohanian, serena williams fiance, reddit, venus williams, gayle king, ted 2017", "news_keywords": "Vancouver Convention Centre, ted talk, serena williams, serena williams pregnant, Alexis Ohanian, serena williams fiance, reddit, venus williams, gayle king, ted 2017", "description": "Serena Williams opened up about her pregnancy to Gayle King at the 2017 Ted Talk in Vancouver", "og": {"title": "Serena Williams Says She Accidentally Announced Her Pregnancy: 'You Press the Wrong Button And...'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/serena-williams-accidentally-announced-pregnancy/", "description": "Serena Williams opened up about her pregnancy to Gayle King at the 2017 Ted Talk in Vancouver", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/serena-williams2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1125px%2C590.625px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/serena-williams-accidentally-announced-pregnancy/", "description": "Serena Williams opened up about her pregnancy to Gayle King at the 2017 Ted Talk in Vancouver", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/serena-williams2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1125px%2C590.625px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/serena-williams-accidentally-announced-pregnancy/", "title": "Serena Williams Says She Accidentally Announced Her Pregnancy: 'You Press the Wrong Button And...'", "description": "Serena Williams opened up about her pregnancy to Gayle King at the 2017 Ted Talk in Vancouver", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/serena-williams2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1125px%2C590.625px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
