I\u2019ve continued to perform here and there but I\u2019ve been really scared to do something of this magnitude because I have unpredictable symptoms,\u201d Debbie shared. \u201cMy nervous system was acting out yesterday. I didn\u2019t sleep last night. It really tests your strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, it just feels like I haven\u2019t slept in four days. But again, you know what, I\u2019ve learned through this journey that everyone is going through something,\u201d she explained after her first dance in the ballroom. \u201cYou can look at people and you just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through. So, you know, I\u2019ve done more this month, in the past month, preparing for this show than I have in an entire year.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cOnly in My Dreams\u201d singer was diagnosed with Lyme disease back in 2013 after experiencing symptoms of extreme pain, weight loss, weakness and joint pain. She told PEOPLE that when she was offered the chance to participate on the show she was \u201cgoing through the fire again,\u201d but pushed through in hopes of inspiring those who are also struggling with their health.\n\n\u201cFor anyone at home going through anything, I want to be here to say you don\u2019t have to get stuck, you don\u2019t have to curl up in a ball on your couch,\u201d she shared. \u201cYou can live, you can get busy living.\u201d", "images": ["https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2015/09/Dancing-with-the-Stars-Paula-Deen-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2017/01/13835581-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/08/21539416-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/09/Peta-Maksim-and-Val-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2017/03/03659741-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2018/04/Alexis-and-Alan-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/05/shutterstock_83657881-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_74,$w_115/f10/2019/11/shutterstock_1416084275-1-620x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_80,$w_125/f10/2017/09/Drew-and-Emma.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/concourse-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/09/Alana-and-Tristan-and-Artem-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/06/20105510-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/09/GettyImages-1175176534-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2017/10/06506224-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_140,$w_140/f10/2018/04/Alexis-and-Alan-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2017/08/16730148-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/10/13068084-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/08/shutterstock_1157214829-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/05/GettyImages-1043397520-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_74,$w_115/f10/2018/10/19996859-620x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/10/Pamela-Anderson-DWTS-season-15-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_140,$w_140/f10/2017/03/03659741-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2016/09/8564968-400x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/trending_up.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/logo.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/qool-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2018/04/Val-and-Laurie-DWTS-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_74,$w_115/f10/2019/11/07642197-620x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/07/08320914-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/04/6970080-400x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/logo-white.png"], "top_img": "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2015/09/Dancing-with-the-Stars-Paula-Deen-400x400.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Di Pede"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fame10.com/trending-news/dancing-with-the-stars-debbie-gibson-gets-emotional-in-first-performance-since-lyme-disease-diagnosis/", "title": "Dancing with the Stars\u2019 Debbie Gibson Gets Emotional In First Performance Since Lyme Disease Diagnosis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1130, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Despite it only being week one, contestant Debbie Gibson has already overcome huge obstacles during her time on Dancing with the Stars!
