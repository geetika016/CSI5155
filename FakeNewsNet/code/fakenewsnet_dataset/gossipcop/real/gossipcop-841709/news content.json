It\u2019s what happened when Demi Lovato challenged James Corden to sing diva hits with an a cappella accompaniment.\n\nThe pop singer heard Corden telling his Late Late Show audience on Wednesday that divas from the age of Tina Turner and Cher are better than ones from today. So, she brought out a cappella group Level to see which songs hold up.\n\n\u201cI got hits from before you were born,\u201d Corden said.\n\n\u201cAnd, um, I got hits that are my own,\u201d Lovato fired back.\n\nThe \u201cBody Say\u201d songstress kicked things off by performing Adele\u2019s \u201cRolling in the Deep,\u201d which Corden followed with Turner\u2019s \u201cRiver Deep, Mountain High.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, that was terrible, just really awful, bad,\u201d Lovato said as they proceeded to trade off covers of Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cRespect\u201d and Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cRoar.\u201d Even Corden had to admit her belting rendition was top notch. She then dropped the mic after riling up the crowd with a hit of her own, \u201cHeart Attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you just pick my mic up\u2026b\u2014-,\u201d she told Corden. After the late-night host wept over his loss, they settled their differences by dueting on Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive.\u201d\n\nWatch the riff-off in the clip above.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a147acd56f71c458ad74777cefaea83?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/110588_0159b.jpg?crop=759px%2C40px%2C1142px%2C1141px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110217_0832b.jpg?crop=42px%2C0px%2C2402px%2C1801px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110217_0832b.jpg?crop=42px%2C0px%2C2402px%2C1801px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/04/06/demi-lovato-james-corden-diva-riff-off/", "title": "Demi Lovato belts Adele, Katy Perry in a cappella diva 'riff-off' with James Corden", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Demi Lovato, James Corden, Adele, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Katy Perry", "news_keywords": "Demi Lovato, James Corden, Adele, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Katy Perry", "description": "It was modern divas vs. classic divas in the musical gauntlet.", "og": {"title": "Demi Lovato Belts Adele, Katy Perry In A Cappella Diva 'Riff-Off' With James Corden", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/04/06/demi-lovato-james-corden-diva-riff-off/", "description": "It was modern divas vs. classic divas in the musical gauntlet.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110217_0832b.jpg?crop=42px%2C0px%2C2402px%2C1801px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/04/06/demi-lovato-james-corden-diva-riff-off/", "description": "It was modern divas vs. classic divas in the musical gauntlet.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110217_0832b.jpg?crop=42px%2C0px%2C2402px%2C1801px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/04/06/demi-lovato-james-corden-diva-riff-off/", "title": "Demi Lovato Belts Adele, Katy Perry In A Cappella Diva 'Riff-Off' With James Corden", "description": "It was modern divas vs. classic divas in the musical gauntlet.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110217_0832b.jpg?crop=42px%2C0px%2C2402px%2C1801px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491451200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
