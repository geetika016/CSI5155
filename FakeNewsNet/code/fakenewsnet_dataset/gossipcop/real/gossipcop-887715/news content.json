The director got his big break in the early \u201990s when Miramax, which Weinstein co-founded with his brother, bought the distribution to his low-budget indie film \u201cClerks\u201d after the producer viewed it at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nYet after a seriesof reports detailed Weinstein\u2019s decades of sexual misconduct in recent weeks, Smith tweeted that he was \u201cashamed\u201d to be profiting from his relationship with the producer while \u201cothers were in terrible pain.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the \u201cJay and Silent Bob\u201d star announced on his podcast, \u201cHollywood Babble-On,\u201d that he would donate future residuals from all his Weinstein-linked projects to Women in Film, a nonprofit that supports female filmmakers.\n\n\u201cMy entire career is tied up with the man,\u201d Smith said on his podcast, recorded in front of a live audience. \u201cIt\u2019s been a weird fucking week. I just wanted to make some fucking movies, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why I came, that\u2019s why I made \u2018Clerks.\u2019 And no fucking movie is worth all this. Like, my entire career, fuck it, take it. It\u2019s wrapped up in something really fucking horrible.\u201d", "images":
