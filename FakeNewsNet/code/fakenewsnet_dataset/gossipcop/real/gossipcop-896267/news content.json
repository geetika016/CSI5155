Today is the 3 year anniversary of his passing and I think this year is one of the hardest- as it\u2019s real now,\u201d wrote the mother of three.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not coming back and the shock is finally gone,\u201d she continued. \u201cToday and every single day, Mikey, we miss you.\u201d\n\n\n\nRELATED: Michael Cavallari: a Timeline of His Troubled Past and Tragic Disappearance\n\nIn December 2015, nearly two weeks after he went missing, Michael was found dead. He was 30. Utah police had been searching for Michael since Nov. 27, 2015, after his 2014 Honda Civic was discovered abandoned on I-70 in the state.\n\nOfficials said Michael\u2019s body was discovered in the Salt Wash area near exit 175 on I-70 in Grand County, which is described as having steep and rocky terrain.\n\n\u201cMy heart is in a million pieces,\u201d Kristin wrote on Instagram on Dec. 10, 2015. \u201cMikey, I could always count on you to make me laugh. You had such a good heart and will be forever missed. I\u2019m at a loss for words but I know u are in a better place and finally at peace. I love u so much RIP.\u201d\n\nOn the second anniversary of his death, Kristin posted an Instagram tribute in his honor, writing, \u201cThis past week has been hard- it\u2019s the 2nd anniversary of losing my brother and even though the date we go with is the 27th, for me it will always be the Saturday after thanksgiving (we will never truly know the exact date even though we have a pretty good idea). We lost him completely unexpectedly and it\u2019s been a rough road for me and my family. I\u2019ve had some incredible signs from him though- which give me a lot of peace- including one today \ud83d\udd6f. We love and miss you everyday Mikey.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis past February, Kristin opened up about her brother\u2019s death on Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry, on which she admitted: \u201cHe was dealing with some demons, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my brother died, he got out of his car and he was walking,\u201d she told Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wanted to be found. But did it get to a point where he got lost out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI kept hearing, \u2018I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u2019 \u201d revealed Henry. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an emphasis on two factors playing on someone\u2019s mental state. It\u2019s kind of like, \u2018There\u2019s no saving me.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBurying her face in her hands, Cavallari broke down and admitted, \u201cIt kills me.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari-brother-mikey.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari-brother-mikey.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari-brother-mikey.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kristin-cavallari-tribute-brother-michael-3-year-anniversary-death/", "title": "Kristin Cavallari Grieves Brother Mikey on 3-Year Anniversary of His Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Anniversaries,Death,Kristin Cavallari,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Anniversaries,Death,Kristin Cavallari,News,TV", "description": "\"Today and every single day, Mikey, we miss you,\" Kristin Cavallari wrote", "og": {"title": "Kristin Cavallari Grieves Her Late Brother Michael on 3-Year Anniversary of His Death: 'This Year Is One of the Hardest'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kristin-cavallari-tribute-brother-michael-3-year-anniversary-death/", "description": "\"Today and every single day, Mikey, we miss you,\" Kristin Cavallari wrote", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari-brother-mikey.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kristin-cavallari-tribute-brother-michael-3-year-anniversary-death/", "description": "\"Today and every single day, Mikey, we miss you,\" Kristin Cavallari wrote", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari-brother-mikey.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kristin-cavallari-tribute-brother-michael-3-year-anniversary-death/", "title": "Kristin Cavallari Grieves Her Late Brother Michael on 3-Year Anniversary of His Death: 'This Year Is One of the Hardest'", "description": "\"Today and every single day, Mikey, we miss you,\" Kristin Cavallari wrote", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari-brother-mikey.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
