Show the board how stupid and paranoid you are.\n\nAntis don't insult other antis. I agree with the poster who called you a loon. Many posters have been here, albeit, off and on, for years. We aren't loons. We haven't spent the last 12 years following AVIDLY everything the couple did. We come here occasionally when something interesting happens and ... funny thing. We see EXACTLY the same loons posting under different names, under guest, pretending to be men, etc. You loons think that if you use different sentence structures, we won't be able to tell who you are. This is because you fail to understand that grammar, syntax, and punctuation are singular to people, some more than others. We always knew exactly which loon was posting from the way the post was structured -- no matter how hard you all tried to hide it. That's how that one poster knew immediately that the Marc Langg guy was a troll and not a loon. I knew something was off, but I couldn't put my finger on it until she pointed it out.At this stage in the game -- twelve years down the road and with the two split up -- the only loons still here are the hardest of the hard core. And there isn't a single one of those loon who could go ten posts without slamming Jen Aniston somehow. They hate Jen more than they love Jolie. No one knows why. But they simply couldn't write that many posts without going off on Jen about something. Antis notice things like this. This is how we know who you are, even when you try -- as Nishag, Levan, Sanctimonious Loon, whatever-names-she's-using-now loon try to come across as someone who is neutral, just trying to see both sides. Your whole writing style, even the way you word things gives you away.", "images": ["http://moziru.com/images/puppy-clipart-big-eye-1.jpg", "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/download/file.php?avatar=282905_1483732307.jpg", "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif", "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/a/a-youtuber-was-killed-in-the-uks-first-fatal-electric-scoote.jpg", "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye7.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/a/asbestos-d0f211e65431e677dd9353d8d30c22fc3f79a9f7.jpg", "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/b/breakfast-3d75f91930db7927bff66ccc8624c4a55ed5e763.jpg", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/sperm-whale-e4ddd1483a172130c845c2bb2470b007f7511b73.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/stormzy-2c8e48b7a76bb111cd42d9210426ce13d2c53e81.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/c/crisps-8635d25403fc6b07aee7959a22ab05c28a454ae3.jpg", "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/tounge.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/j/james-corden-ac3142ee741c088d8ebad21efda6defa6b0b5c0c.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/w/woman-becomes-worlds-first-professional-bed-warmer-a77848ae1.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/n/nicki-minaj-at-the-mtv-vmas-68b424602530ec3fb0ff669aa2782560.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/r/ryan-mark-parsons-ff8b7a7472d4eca20b65b5bea8922893fe7e8037.jpg"], "top_img": "http://moziru.com/images/puppy-clipart-big-eye-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=749032&start=90", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
