And to celebrate their return, Dynasty showrunner Sallie Patrick will be blogging major episodes for EW throughout the show\u2019s first season. This week, she\u2019s sharing some insights on Cristal\u2019s first day as COO and so much more.\n\n\u201cCompany Slut\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s episode was directed by the marvelous Cherie Nowlan and was written by Chris Fife. I\u2019ve written with Chris on two shows before Dynasty (Life Unexpected and Revenge), and it was a no-brainer for me when staffing this show that he had to be a part of it. He\u2019s not only a fan of the OG Dynasty, but he\u2019s an encyclopedia of soap and all-around wonderful person to have in the writers\u2019 room. For someone who can write catty lines so well, he\u2019s actually quite a nice guy.\n\n\u201cCompany Slut\u201d is a packed hour, spanning from a wish-fulfilling montage in which Cristal chooses what to wear for her first day as a COO \u2014 she\u2019s trying to keep her chin up after all the drama with her sex tape \u2014 to a much darker ending, when Cristal tries to make amends with Claudia Blaisdel\u2026 Much of the drama in Dynasty comes from the moments when good intentions go terribly wrong. And let\u2019s just say, Blake running over Claudia with his car isn\u2019t going to make their lives any easier.\n\nI love this episode because it gave us the opportunity to talk about issues that are important to me: female empowerment, how women treat each other in the work place, and of course, how to wear a cape to a board meeting (only Cristal could pull that off). As for music, from the script stage, we knew we wanted Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World\u201d to open the show, and that it should be covered by a woman (Red Rosamond). It felt like an appropriate anthem for Cristal, who\u2019s trying to keep her head high, and it also echoes her battle with Fallon. Their tete-a-tete in the foyer is an awesome shade-throwing match \u2014 they\u2019re each struggling with their own battles to prove themselves as career women \u2014 but it\u2019s also a key moment in their season-long arc, by the end of which we hope they\u2019ll learn there\u2019s space enough for them both to rule the world.\n\nFUN FACTS:\n\nBelieve it or not, the champagne spray moment was rehearsed several times, with and without our actors \u2014 even something that seems so simple must go perfectly or we ruin hair/makeup/wardrobe for no good reason. But on the day, the women got it in one try. Because they\u2019re pros.\n\nThe presentation of the watch to Cristal (Blake\u2019s gift for her first day as COO) was a callback to the OG Dynasty when Blake had earrings sent up to Cristal\u2019s bridal shower. Our props department even used similar wrapping.\n\nwhen Blake had earrings sent up to Cristal\u2019s bridal shower. Our props department even used similar wrapping. \u201cDid they remember the chocolate cake?\u201d is a classic Sammy Jo line. Even when he\u2019s away from the Manor, he knows the importance of good (free) food.\n\nMy favorite \u201cship\u201d of the series is Anders and Sammy Jo. I love their arc in this episode. Even if Anders was manipulating Sam to go to Ted\u2026 (Also, I\u2019d really like my own movie theater complete with that candy cart.)\n\nI love how Steven\u2019s arc and ability to forgive Sammy Jo contrasts with Blake\u2019s inability to forgive Fallon, dramatizing how Steven continues to be quite different from his father\u2026\n\nTed Dinard is a character from the OG Dynasty who played a big part in season 1\u2026 So let\u2019s just say, he\u2019ll be back.\n\nImage zoom Chris Fife\n\nShooting our first scene of the episode in the master bedroom\n\nImage zoom Chris Fife\n\nAnother dysfunctional family dinner \u2014 all smiles between takes!\n\nImage zoom Chris Fife\n\nImage zoom Chris Fife\n\nOutside Carrington Manor", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dynasty-recap-10-11-17.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/dynasty3.jpg?crop=50px%2C116px%2C1677px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/dynasty.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1514.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dynasty-october-25-2017-recap.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dynasty-nov-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dynasty-10-18-17-recap3.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2064'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1517.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_1516.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/dynasty3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/dynasty3.jpg?crop=50px%2C116px%2C1677px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sallie Patrick", "Marc Snetiker", "Maggie Fremont"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/08/dynasty-episode-5-blog-sallie-patrick/", "title": "Dynasty showrunner shares secrets from 'Company Slut'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Dynasty, Dynasty blog, Dynasty CW, Dynasty original, dynasty reboot, dynasty showrunner, Sallie Patrick, Company Slut", "news_keywords": "Dynasty, Dynasty blog, Dynasty CW, Dynasty original, dynasty reboot, dynasty showrunner, Sallie Patrick, Company Slut", "description": "Sallie Patrick blogs episode 5 and takes fans inside that shocking ending.", "og": {"title": "'Dynasty' showrunner shares secrets from 'Company Slut'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/08/dynasty-episode-5-blog-sallie-patrick/", "description": "The Carringtons are back and as glamorous as ever!
