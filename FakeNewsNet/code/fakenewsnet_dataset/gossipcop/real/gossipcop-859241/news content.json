And it\u2019s harder than you think,\u201d she said on Tuesday\u2019s show. \u201cI love water aerobics!\u201d\n\nThe Scandal star, 40, also told DeGeneres about how she ended up becoming a certified yoga teacher.\n\n\u201cI went to India after college and studied [\u2026] traditional Indian martial arts and cultural movement, and I was studying yoga and I thought, \u2018I\u2019ll be able to make a living when I go back,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThis was right after college, so I was going to go to New York and be a starving artist and try to be an actor.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Half Their Size: Christina Jordan on the Moment She Decided to Lose Weight\n\nInstead, she ended up moving back home and used her training to teach her mother yoga \u2014 but that didn\u2019t go so well.\n\n\u201cMy mother said that she would let me live at home if I taught her yoga for an hour a day,\u201d said Washington. \u201cThat lasted for a week. She was like, \u2018I hate yoga! You may not be able to live here if you keep doing this.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe Ellen DeGeneres Show airs weekdays (check local listings).", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kerry-washington-a-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kerry-washington-a-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabrielle Olya"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/bodies/kerry-washington-pregnancy-workout-water-aerobics/", "title": "Kerry Washington's Go-to Pregnancy Workout Was Water Aerobics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kerry washington, kerry washington workout, kerry washington fitness, ellen show, kerry washington ellen, ellen degeneres, the ellen degeners show, kerry washington pregnancy workout", "news_keywords": "kerry washington, kerry washington workout, kerry washington fitness, ellen show, kerry washington ellen, ellen degeneres, the ellen degeners show, kerry washington pregnancy workout", "description": "Kerry Washington swore by water aerobics to stay active while pregnant", "og": {"title": "Kerry Washington's Go-To Pregnancy Workout Was '70s-Style Water Aerobics'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/kerry-washington-pregnancy-workout-water-aerobics/", "description": "Kerry Washington swore by water aerobics to stay active while pregnant", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kerry-washington-a-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/bodies/kerry-washington-pregnancy-workout-water-aerobics/", "description": "Kerry Washington swore by water aerobics to stay active while pregnant", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kerry-washington-a-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/kerry-washington-pregnancy-workout-water-aerobics/", "title": "Kerry Washington's Go-To Pregnancy Workout Was '70s-Style Water Aerobics'", "description": "Kerry Washington swore by water aerobics to stay active while pregnant", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kerry-washington-a-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3ILWkbF4H4"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
