But the singer also moved to the backseat where she enjoyed a romantic date night with husband Brandon Blackstock as Corden played chauffeur for the couple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because I work a lot and I\u2019m a mom but we try,\u201d Clarkson said of spending time with her husband away from work when he\u2019s not also being her manager.\n\n\u201cIs this intervention?\u201d the mother of two said before being surprised by her husband with sparkling apple cider, a rose, chocolate covered strawberries and a violinist.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re making a porn,\u201d Blackstock joked.\n\nImage zoom CBS\n\nRELATED: Kelly Clarkson \u2018Never Felt Sexually Attracted to Anybody\u2019 Before Husband Brandon Blackstock\n\nThe pair, who married in 2013, first met at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2006 where Clarkson was performing a duet with Rascal Flatts on their tune \u201cWhat Hurts the Most.\u201d (Blackstock, who is the former stepson of Reba McEntire, was the country group\u2019s tour manager at the time.)\n\nAnd fast forward to the present, Clarkson shares four kids with Blackstock, including 16-year-old stepdaughter Savannah, 10-year-old stepson Seth, 3-year-old daughter River Rose and 19-month-old son Remington \u201cRemy\u201d Alexander.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kelly Clarkson \u2018Can\u2019t Stop Crying\u2019 Over

Been Gone,\u201d \u201cLove So Soft,\u201d \u201cStronger,\u201d \u201cBecause of You,\u201d and \u201cWhole Lotta Woman\u201d with Corden.\n\nIn addition, the American Idol champion sang the lyrics to \u201cSo This Is Love\u201d from Disney\u2019s Cinderella, which she sings to her youngest child as a lullaby.\n\nThe Late Late Show airs nightly at 12:37 a.m. ET/PT.", "images":
