But as one wife has learned, after so many years, you may just hear music in all the noise.\n\nIn a viral YouTube video, the woman explains that she started recording her husband\u2019s loud snoring about four years ago. Her husband, who sports an impressive mustache, seems to snore whenever he takes a nap\u2014and from the looks of it, he can nap almost anywhere. Whether it\u2019s outdoors during the day, in the backseat of a car, or at the kitchen table with food just inches away, the man is dedicated to catching his beauty sleep.\n\nNeed a little inspiration?

They call their masterpiece, \u201cRonquidito,\u201d a variation of the Spanish word for snoring.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first video to go viral using the catchy tune of \u201cDespacito.\u201d Earlier this month, a young girl went viral after a compilation of her dancing to the song was uploaded to YouTube. Just as our snorer is compelled to nap, the young girl is compelled to dance whenever her brother plays \u201cDespacito,\u201d and their video has scored more than 13 million views to date.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/38f048d622d7a8e3239b68c777a325ef?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/snoring.jpg?crop=0px%2C285px%2C1233px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11375342_417123731803445_2077871559_n-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/snoring.jpg?crop=0px%2C285px%2C1233px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Duaine Hahn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/human-interest/wife-secretly-films-husbands-snoring-for-years-and-hilariously-remixes-it-with-despacito/", "title": "Wife Secretly Films Husband's Snoring for Years and Hilariously Remixes It with 'Despacito'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "snoring, funny, comedy, viral video, snorer, despacito, youtube", "news_keywords": "snoring, funny, comedy, viral video, snorer, despacito, youtube", "description": "As this wife finds out, after so many years of living with a snorer, you may hear music in all the noise.", "og": {"title": "Wife Secretly Films Husband's Snoring for Years and Hilariously Remixes It with 'Despacito'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/wife-secretly-films-husbands-snoring-for-years-and-hilariously-remixes-it-with-despacito/", "description": "It may be tough living with a snorer.
